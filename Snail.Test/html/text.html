<h1 align=center>Large Text Compression Benchmark</h1>
<p align=center>Matt Mahoney<br>
Last update: Nov. 20, 2012. <a href=#history>history</a><br>

<p>This competition ranks lossless data compression programs by the compressed
size (including the size of the decompression program) of the first 
10<sup>9</sup> bytes of the XML text dump of the English version of Wikipedia on Mar. 3, 2006.
<a href=textdata.html>About the test data</a>.

<p>The goal of this benchmark is not to find the best overall compression program, but
to encourage research in artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP).
A fundamental problem in both NLP and text compression is modeling: the ability to
distinguish between high probability strings like <i>recognize speech</i> and low 
probability strings like <i>reckon eyes peach</i>.
<a href=rationale.html>Rationale</a>.

<p>This is an open benchmark.  Anyone may contribute results.  Please read the
<a href=textrules.html>rules</a> first.

<p>Compression improvements to the first 10<sup>8</sup> bytes are eligible for the
<a href=http://prize.hutter1.net/>Hutter Prize</a>, with 50,000 euros of funding.

<h2>Benchmark Results</h2>

<p>Compressors are ranked by the compressed size of enwik9 (10<sup>9</sup> bytes) 
plus the size of a zip archive containing the decompresser.  Options are selected
for maximum compression at the cost of speed and memory.  Other data in the table does not
affect rankings.  This benchmark is for informational purposes only.  There is no prize money
for a top ranking.  Notes about the table:

<ul>
<li><b>Program:</b> The version believed to give the best compression.  A | denotes a combination of 2 programs.

<li><b>Compression options:</b> selected for what I believe gives the best compression.

<li><b>enwik8:</b> compressed size of first 10<sup>8</sup> bytes of enwik9.  This data is used for
the Hutter Prize, and is also ranked
<a href=http://compressionratings.com/sort.cgi?txt2.full+6ne_old>
here</a> but has no effect on this ranking.

<li><b>enwik9:</b> compressed size of first 10<sup>9</sup> bytes of enwiki-20060303-pages-articles.xml.

<li><b>decompresser size:</b> size of a zip archive containing the decompression program
(source code or executable)
and all associated files needed to run it (e.g. dictionaries).  A letter
following the size has the following meaning:
 <ul>
 <li>x = executable size.
 <li>s = source code size (if available and smaller).
 <li>d = size of a separate decompression program (separate from compression).
  For self extracting archives (SFX), the size is 0 because the decompresser
  and compressed data are combined into one file.
 </ul>
For testing, if no zip file is supplied I create archives using InfoZIP 2.32 -9.
(Prior to July 1, 2008 I used 7zip 4.32 -tzip -mx=9).

<li><b>Total size:</b> total size of compressed enwik9 + decompresser size,
ranked smallest to largest.

<li><b>Comp:</b> compression rate in nanoseconds per byte on the largest file tested
(e.g. seconds for enwik9).  Speed is approximate
and has no effect on ranking.  A ~ means "very approximate".  Not all tests are
done on the same computer. Times reported are the
smaller of process time (summed over processors if multi-threaded) or real time as measured with 
<a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=116710&release_id=647992&package_id=300349>timer</a>).
If there is no note then the program was tested on a Compaq Presario 5440, 2.188 GHz, Athlon-64 3500+
in 32 bit Windows XP.
An underlined time means that no better compressor is faster.

<li><b>Decomp:</b> decompression time as above.  If blank, decompression was
not tested yet and ranking is pending verification that the output is identical.
An underlined time means that no better compressor is faster.

<li><b>Mem:</b> approximate memory used for compression in MB.  Decompression uses
the same or possibly less.  There is some ambiguity whether a megabyte means 10<sup>6</sup> bytes
or 2<sup>20</sup> bytes.  The approximation is course enough that it doesn't matter.
I use peak memory as measured with Windows Task Manager during compression
(so if you really want to know, 1 MB = 1,024,000 bytes :)  Memory does not include
swap or temporary files.
An underlined value means that no better compressor uses less memory.

<li><b>Alg:</b> compression algorithm, referring to the method of parsing the
input into symbols (strings, bytes, or bits) and estimating their probabilities 
(modeling) for choosing code lengths.  Symbols may be arithmetic coded 
(fractional bit length for best compression), Huffman coded (bit aligned for speed),
or byte aligned as a preprocessing step.
<ul>
<li>Dict (Dictionary).  Symbols are words, coded as 1 or 2 bytes, usually as a preprocessing step.
<li>LZ (Lempel Ziv).  Symbols are strings.
<ul>
  <li>LZ77: repeated strings are coded by offset and length of previous occurrence.
  <li>LZW (LZ Welch): repeats are coded as indexes into a dynamically built dictionary.
  <li>ROLZ (Reduced Offset LZ): LZW with multiple small dictionaries selected by context.
  <li>LZP (LZ predictive): ROLZ with a dictionary size of 1.
</ul>
<li>on (Order-n, e.g. o0, o1, o2...): symbols are bytes, modeled by frequency distribution in context of last n bytes.
<li>PPM (Prediction by Partial Match): order-n, modeled in longest context matched, but dropping to lower orders for byte counts of 0.
<li>SR (Symbol Ranking): order-n, modeled by time since last seen.
<li>BWT (Burrows Wheeler Transform): bytes are sorted by context, then modeled by order-0 SR.
<li>ST (Sort Transform): BWT using stable sort with truncated string comparison.
<li>DMC (Dynamic Markov Coding): bits modeled by PPM.
<li>CM (Context Mixing): bits, modeled by combining predictions of independent models.
</ul>
Some compressors combine multiple steps such as Dict+PPM or LZP+DMC.  I indicate
the last stage before coding.

<li><b>Notes:</b> Brief notes.  See program descriptions for details.
Usually this means the result was reported by somebody else
on a different computer.
</ul>

(options for maximum compression).

<a name=notes>
<h3>Notes about compressors</h3>

<p>I only test the latest supported version of a program.  I attempt to find the
options that select the best compression, but will not generally do an exhausitve
search.  If an option advertises maximum compression or memory, I don't try the alternatives.
If you know of a better combination, please let me know.
I will select the maximum memory setting that does not cause disk thrashing, usually about 1800 MB.
If the compressor is not downloadable as a zip file then I will compress the source or
executable (whichever archive is smaller) plus any other needed files (dictionaries) into a single zip
archive using 7zip 4.32 -tzip -mx=9.
If no executable is available I will attempt to compile in C or C++ 
(MinGW 3.4.2, Borland 5.5 or Digital Mars), Java 1.5.0, MASM, NASM, or gas.

<a name=about>
<h2 align=center>About the Compressors</h2>

<p>The numbers in the headings are the compression ratios on enwik9.

<a name=1277>
<h3>.1277 durilca</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.compression.ru/ds/>durilca</a> and durilca'light 0.5 by Dmitry Shkarin
(Apr. 1, 2006) are closed source, experimental command line file compressors
based on ppmd/ppmonstr with filters for text,
exe, and data with fixed length records (wav, bmp, etc).  durilca'light is a faster
version with less compression.  Unfortunately both
crash on enwik9.  Decompression is verified on enwik8.

<p>The -m700 option selects 700 MB of memory.  (It appears to use
substantially more for enwik9 according to Windows task manager).
-o12 selects PPM order 12 (optimal for enwik9 -t0).
-t0 (default) turns off text modeling, which hurts compression but is necessary
to compress enwik9 (although decompression still crashes).  -t2(3) turns
on text preprocessing (dictionary; thus the increased decompresser size).
-t2 also supports 3 additive flags (4, 8, 16) which have no effect on this
data, thus -t2(31) or -t2 (default is 31) give the same compression as -t(3).

<p><a href=durilca05h.rar>durilca 0.5(Hutter)</a>
was released 1457Z Aug. 16, 2006.  It does not use external dictionaries.
When run with 1 GB memory (-m700), -o13 is optimal.  With 2 GB (-m1650), -o21 is optimal.
The unzipped .exe file is 86,016 bytes.

<p><a href=DURILCA4Linux_1.rar>durilca4linux_1</a>
(0825Z Aug 23 2006)
is a Linux version of durilca 0.5(Hutter) which successfully compresses enwik9 and
decompresses with <a href=UnDur.zip>UnDur</a>
(23,375 bytes zipped, 42,065 bytes uncompressed).  All
versions of durilca require memory specified by -m plus memory to read the input file
into memory.  In Windows, this exceeds the 2 GB process limit regardless of available
RAM and swap.  Thus, enwik9 compresses
only under Linux with 2 GB real memory and 1 GB additional swap.  
The -o12 option is optimal for enwik9 (tested under 64 bit SuSE 10.0 by the author), 
-o24 for enwik8 (verified by me under 64 bit Ubuntu 2.6.15).

<p><a href=DURILCA4Linux_2.rar>durilca4linux_2</a>
(Oct. 16, 2006)
is a closed source Linux version specialized for this benchmark.
It includes a warning that use on other files may cause data loss.
It requires AMD64 Linux and 3 GB of memory (2 GB for enwik8).
The decompresser files (EnWiki.dur and UnDur)
are contained within a 241,322 byte zip file in the rar distribution.  To compress:
<pre>
  ./DURILCA d EnWiki.dur
  ./DURILCA e -m1800 -o10 -t2 enwik9
</pre>
To decompress:
<pre>
  ./UnDur EnWiki.dur
  ./UnDur enwik9.dur
</pre>
The first step extracts a compressed dictionary.  It is organized in a similar 
manner to paq8hp2-paq8hp5 in that
syntactically related words and words with the same suffix are grouped together.
Results are reported by the author under Suse Linux 10.0.
I verified enwik8 only (6480 ns/b to compress on a 2.2 GHz Athlon 64 with 
2 GB memory under Ubuntu Linux).  enwik9 caused disk thrashing.

<p><a href=DURILCA4Linux_3.rar>durilca4linux_3</a>
(dictionary version v1)
was released Feb. 21, 2008.  Like version 2, it requires extraction of EnWiki.dur
before compressing or decompressing, and may not work with files other than
enwik8 and enwik9.  As tested, requires 64-bit Linux, 4 GB RAM, and 5 GB RAM+swap.

<p><a href=undur3v2.zip>undur3 v2</a> contains
an improved dictionary (version v2), released Apr. 22, 2008,
for DURILCA4Linux_3.  The compression
and decompression programs are the same.  The decompression program UnDur (Linux
executable) is included.  To compress, download durilca4linux_3 and replace the
dictionary (EnWiki.dur) with this one.  The options are -m3600 (3600 MB memory),
-o14 (order 14 PPM), -t2 (text model 2).

<p><a href=undur3v3.zip>undur3 v3</a>,
released May 22, 2008,
uses an improved dictionary but the same compressor and decompresser as v1 and v2.
The dictionary contains 123,995 lowercase words separated by NUL bytes.
Of these, 5579 words occur more than once (wasted space?)
I tested options -m1500 under Ubuntu Linix with 2 GB memory.
At -m1500 <tt>top</tt> reports 2157 MB virtual memory and 1894 MB real memory. -m1600
caused disk thrashing.

<p><a href=durilca_kingsize.rar>durilca
kingsize</a> (July 21, 2009) runs under 64 bit Windows and requires 13 GB memory.
It is designed to work only on this benchmark and not in general. The dictionary
file EnWiki.fsd must be extracted first from EnWiki.dur before compression or
decompression. Requires msvcr90.dll. enwik8 can be compressed with -m1200 (1.2 GB).

<p><a href=durilca4_decoder.zip>durilca4_decoder</a> is a new dictionary for
durilca'kingsize (above), Nov. 12, 2009. It is reported as
"durilca'kingsize_4" below. Decompression time is reported to be
1411.88 sec with "durilca d" and 1796.98 sec with "UnDur". enwik8
compresses with 1200 MB (-m1200) in 157.38 sec.

<h3>.1323 paq8hp12any</h3>

<p>paq8hp12any was developed as a fork of the 
<a href=index.html>PAQ series</a> of open source context mixing compressors by Alexander
Rhatushnyak. It was forked from the paq8 series
developed largely by Matt Mahoney, and uses a dictionary
preprocessor (xml-wrt) originally developed by Przemyslaw Skibinski as a separate
program and later integrated. All versions are optimized for
the Hutter prize. Thus, they are tuned for enwik8. The 12 versions are
described below in chronological order. They originally were located
<a href=http://start.binet.com.ua/~artest/HKCC/>here</a> (link broken)
and can now be found
<a href=http://artst.narod.ru/binet/all_HKCC.rar>here</a>
<a href=all_HKCC.zpaq>(as a zpaq archive)</a> (as of Sept. 16, 2009).
All programs are free, GPL open source, command line archivers.  Most take a
single option controlling memory usage.

<p>Note: these programs are compressed
with upack, which compresses better than upx. Some virus detectors
give false alarms on all upack-compressed executables. The programs
are not infected.

<p>paq8hp1 by Alexander Rhatushnyak, 1945Z Aug. 21, 2006.  It is a modification of paq8h
using a custom dictionary tuned to enwik8 for the Hutter prize.  Because the
Hutter prize requires no external dictionaries, the dictionary is spliced into
the .exe file during the build process.  When run, it creates 
the dictionary as a temporary file.  The program must be run in the current
directory (not in your PATH or with an explicit path), or else it can't find
this file.  The unzipped paq8hp1.exe is 206,764 bytes.
Decompression was verified for enwik8 (60730 ns/b for -8, 60660 ns/b for -7).
enwik9 is pending.

<p>paq8hp2
(<a href=paq8hp2s.rar>source code</a>)
by Alexander Rhatushnyak, 0233Z Aug. 28, 2006 is an improved version of paq8hp1
submitted for the Hutter prize.  paq8hp2.exe size is 205,276 bytes.
It differs from paq8hp1 mainly in that the 43K word dictionary for 2-3 byte codes is sorted alphabetically.
The 80 most frequent words, coded as 1 byte before compression, are grouped by syntactic type
(pronoun, preposition, etc).

<p>paq8hp3
(<a href=paq8hp3s.rar>source code</a>)
by Alexander Rhatushnyak, released Aug. 29, 2006 is an improved version of paq8hp2
submitted for the Hutter prize on Sept. 3, 2006.
The 80 dictionary words coded with 1 byte and 2560 words coded with 2 bytes
are organized into semantically related groups or by common suffixes.
The 40,960 words with 3 byte codes are sorted from the last character in reverse
alphabetical order.  paq8hp3.exe is 178,468 bytes unzipped.
enwik9 decompression is not yet verified.  For enwik8, decompression is verified
with time 60300 ns/b compression, 60220 ns/b decompression.

<p>paq8hp4
(<a href=paq8hp4s.rar>source code</a>)
by Alexander Rhatushnyak, released and submitted for the Hutter prize on
Sept. 10, 2006, is an improved version of paq8hp3.
The dictionary is further organized into semantically related groups among 3-byte codes.
The unzipped size of paq8hp4.exe is 206,336 bytes.

<p>paq8hp5
(<a href=paq8hp5s.rar>source code</a>)
by Alexander Rhatushnyak, released Sept. 20, 2006, is an improved version of paq8hp4,
submitted for the Hutter prize on Sept. 25, 2006.
The unzipped size of paq8hp5.exe is 174,616 bytes (in spite of a slightly larger dictionary).
The dictionary size is optimized for enwik8; a larger dictionary would improve compression
of enwik9.  Decompression is verified for enwik8 only (-8 at 74640 ns/b).
A <a href=http://linux.tu-varna.acad.bg/~lig/UNIX/paq8hp5l.rar>Linux port</a> of paq8hp5 is by
Лъчезар Илиев Георгиев (Luchezar Georgiev), Oct 26, 2006
(<a href=paq8hp5l.rar>mirror</a>).

<p>paq8hp6
(<a href=paq8hp6s.rar>source code</a>)
by Alexander Rhatushnyak, released Oct. 29, 2006, is an improved version of paq8hp5.
It was submitted as a Hutter prize candidate on Nov. 6, 2006.
Unzipped paq8hp6.exe size is 170,400 bytes.
The -8 option was not tested on enwik9 due to disk thrashing on my 2 GB PC.  Compression was about
25% finished after 9 hours.

<p>paq8hp7a
by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Dec. 7, 2006, was intended to supercede
paq8hp6 as a Hutter prize entry, 
then was withdrawn on Dec. 10, 2006 with the release of paq8hp7.
Unzipped executable size is 151,664 bytes.  -8 for enwik9 (but not enwik8) caused
disk thrashing on my computer (2 GB, WinXP).

<p>paq8hp7
(<a href=paq8hp7s.rar>source code</a>) by
Alexander Rhatushnyak, Dec. 10, 2006, as a Hutter prize entry.
Unzipped paq8hp7.exe size is 152,556 bytes.

<p>paq8hp8
<a href=paq8hp8s.rar>(source code)</a>
by Alexander Rasushnyak, Jan. 18, 2007, as a Hutter prize entry
(replacing an incorrect version posted 2 days earlier).
Unzipped size is 152,692 bytes.  The dictionary is identical to paq8hp7.

<p>paq8hp9
<a href=http://artst.narod.ru/b/paq8hp9.zip>(mirror)</a>
<a href=paq8hp9s.rar>(source code)</a>
by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Feb. 20, 2007, is a Hutter prize entry.
Only the -7 option works.
The unzipped size of paq8hp9.exe is 112,628 bytes.

<p>paq8hp9any
(Feb. 23, 2007) by Alexander Rhatushnyak
is a paq8hp9 -7 compatible version with external dictionary where all options work.
However the zipped program is larger and -8 was not tested due to disk thrashing,
so results are unchanged.

<p>paq8hp10
(Mar. 26, 2007)
by Alexander Rhatushnyak was derived from paq8hp9 as a Hutter prize entry.
The unzipped size is 103,224 bytes.  Only the -7 option works.

<p>paq8hp10any
<a href=paq8hp10s.rar>(source code)</a>,
Mar. 31, 2007, by Alexander Rhatushnyak is archive compatible with paq8hp10 -7 but
works with other memory options.  When run, paq8hp10.exe and both dictionary
files should be in the current directory.  This program is not a Hutter prize entry.

<p>paq8hp11
<a href=http://artst.narod.ru/b/paq8hp11.zip>(mirror)</a>
by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Apr. 30, 2007, is a Hutter prize entry.
paq8hp11.exe is 99,816 bytes.  Like paq8hp10, it works only with the -7 option.

<p>paq8hp11any
(<a href=paq8hp11any_src.rar>source code</a>)
by Alexander Rhatushnyak, May 2, 2007, is a paq8hp11 variant
that accepts any memory option.  It was optimized for
speed rather than size.  It includes two dictionary files which must
be present in the current directory when run, unlike paq8hp11 where the
dictionary is self extracted.  -8 selects 1850 MB memory.  -7 produces
the same archive as paq8hp11.  Run speeds for -8 enwik8 are 76770+76820 ns/B.

<p>paq8hp12
<a href=http://artst.narod.ru/b/paq8hp12.zip>(mirror)</a>
by Alexander Rhatushnyak, May 14, 2007, is a Hutter prize entry.
paq8hp12.exe size is 99,696 bytes.  It works only with the -7 option like paq8hp11.

<p>paq8hp12any
(<a href=paq8hp12any_src.rar>source code</a>)
by Alexander Rhatushnyak, May 20, 2007, is a paq8hp12 variant that accepts
any memory option (like paq8hp11any).  The -7 option produces an archive
identical to that of paq8hp12.

<p><a href=paq8hp12any_src.zip>paq8hp12any</a> was updated
on Jan. 9, 2009
to fix a compiler issue and add a 64 bit Linux version.
Compressed file format was not changed. It was not retested.

<p>Options select memory usage as shown in the table.

<p>paq8hp1 through paq8hp12 can be used as a preprocessor to other compressors
by compressing with option -0.  In the following tests on ppmonstr, options were tuned
for the best possible compression of enwik8 with 2 GB memory (1.65 GB available under WinXP).
The xml-wrt 2.0 options are -l0 -w -s -c -b255 -m100 -e2300 (level 0, turn off word containers,
turn off space modeling, turn off containers, 255 MB buffer for dictionary, 100 MB buffer,
2300 word dictionary).
The xml-wrt 3.0 options are -l0 -b255 -m255 -3 -s -e7000 (-3 = optimize for PPM).

<p>xml-wrt prepends the dictionary to its output.
To make the comparison fair, the compressed size of the dictionary
must be added.  This is done in two ways, first by compressing the preprocessed text
and dictionary and adding the compressed sizes, 
and second by prepending the dictionary to the preprocessed
text before compression.  The first method compresses about 1-2 KB smaller.

<p>The uncompressed size of each dictionary for paq8hp1 through paq8hp4
is 398,210 bytes.  They contain
identical words, but in different order.  The first two dictionaries are identical.
They compress smaller because they are sorted alphabetically.
The dictionary for paq8hp5 is 411,681 bytes.  It contains all of the words in
the first 4 dictionaries plus 1280 new words (44,880 total).

<p>The transform done by paq8hp1 through paq8hp5
is based on WRT by Przemyslaw Skibinski, which first appeared
in PAsQDa and paqar, and later in paq8g and xml-wrt.  The steps are as follows:
<ul>
<li>The input is parsed into seqences of all uppercase letters or all lowercase letters, or one
uppercase letter followed by lowercase letters, e.g. "THE", "the", or "The".
<li>All uppercase words are prefixed by a special symbol 
(0E hex in paq8hp3, paq8hp4, paq8hp5).  If a lowercase
letter follows with no intervening characters (e.g. "THEre", then a special symbol (0C hex) marks the end.
(e.g. 0E "the" 0C "re").
<li>Capitalized words are prefixed with 7F hex (paq8hp3) or 40 hex (paq8hp4, paq8hp5) 
(e.g. "The" -> 40 "the").
<li>All letters are converted to lower case.
<li>Words are looked up in the dictionary.  The first 80 words in the dictionary are coded with
1 byte: 80, 81, ... CF (hex).
<li>The next 2560 words (paq8hp1-4) or 3840 words (paq8hp5)
are coded with 2 bytes: D080, D081, ... EFCF (paq8hp1-4), or D080, ... FFCF (paq8hp5).
<li>The last 40960 words are coded with 3 bytes: F0D080, F0D081, ... FFEFCF.
<li>If a word does not match, then the longest matching prefix with length at least 6 is coded
and the rest of the word is spelled.
<li>If there is no matching prefix, then the longest matching suffix with length at least 6 is
coded after spelling the preceding letters.
<li>If no matching word, prefix, or suffix is found, the word is spelled.  Capitalization coding
occurs regardless.
<li>Any input bytes with special meaning are escaped by prefixing with 06: 06, 0C, 0E, 40 or 7F, 80-FF.
</ul>
WRT has additional capabilities depending on input, such as skipping encoding if little or no
text is detected.  The dictionary format is one word per line (linefeed only) with a 13 line header.

<h3>.1350 paq8pxd_v4</h3>

<p>paq8pxd_v4
is the latest versions in the following
PAQ series of open source (GPL) context mixing archivers.

<p>p5, p6, and p12 (Matt Mahoney, May 13, 2000) use a neural network
with 256K or 4M inputs, no hidden layer and a single output to predict 
the next bit of input, 
given hashes of various contexts to select active inputs.  The output
is arithmetic coded.  p5 uses 1 MB memory
and context orders 0 to 3.  p6 uses 16 MB and orders 0-5.  p12
uses 16 MB, orders 1-4 and word-level orders 0-1 as an optimization
for text.  The programs take no options.  The algorithm is described in
M. Mahoney,
<a href=mmahoney00.pdf>
<i>Fast Text Compression with Neural Networks</i></a>, Proc. AAAI FLAIRS, Orlando, 2000
(C) 2000, AAAI.

<p>paq1 (Matt Mahoney, Jan. 6, 2001) replaces the neural network in p5, p6, p12 
with a fixed weighted averaging
of model outputs.  Described in an unpublished report, M. Mahoney,
<a href=paq1.pdf><i>The PAQ1
Data Compression Program</i></a>, 2002.

<p>paq6 (Matt Mahoney and Serge Osnach, Dec. 30, 2003) evolved as a series
of improvements to paq1.  It is described in
M. Mahoney, <a href=cs200516.pdf><i>
Adaptive Weighing of Context Models for Lossless Data Compression</i></a>, 
Florida Tech. Technical Report CS-2005-16, 2005.  The most significant
improvements are replacing the fixed model weights with adaptive linear
mixing (Matt Mahoney), and SSE (secondary symbol estimation) postprocessing
on the output probability, and modeling of sparse contexts (Serge Osnach).
Other models were added for x86 executable code, and automatic detection
of fixed length records in binary data. Intermediate versions can be found
<a href=paq.html>here</a>.

<p>paqar 4.5 (Alexander Rhatushnyak, Feb. 13, 2006)
is the last of a long series of improvements to paq6 by
Alexander Rhatushnyak (paqar: multimixer model, .exe preprocessor, other model
improvements), Przemyslaw Skibinski (WRT text preprocessing), Berto Destasio (model tuning),
Fabio Buffoni (speed optimizations), David. A Scott
(arithmetic coder optimizations), Jason Schmidt (model improvements), and
Johan de Bock (compiler optimizations).  For text, the biggest improvement was from
WRT (Word Reducing Transform), 
which replaces words with shorter codes from an external English dictionary
to PAsQDa 1.0 on Jan. 18, 2005.
WRT is described in 
P. Skibiński, Sz. Grabowski, and S. Deorowicz, 
<a href=http://www.ii.uni.wroc.pl/~inikep/papers/05-RevisitingDictCompr.pdf><i>Revisiting
dictionary-based compression</i></a>, Software - Practice & Experience, 35 (15), 
pp. 1455-1476, December 2005.
There were a great number of versions by many contributors, mostly in 2004 when the PAQ 
series moved to the top of most compression benchmarks and attracted interest.
Prior to PAQ, the top ranked programs were generally closed source.

<p><a href=paq8f.zip>paq8f</a> (Matt Mahoney, Feb. 28, 2006) evolved from paq7 (Dec. 24, 2005) as a
complete rewrite of paq6/paqar.  The important improvements were replacing the
adaptive linear mixing of models with a neural network (coded in MMX assembler),
a more memory-efficient mapping of contexts to bit histories using a cache-aligned
hash table, adaptive mapping of bit histories to probabilities,
and models for bmp, tiff, and jpeg images.  It models text using whole-word
contexts and case folding, like all versions back to p12, but lacks WRT text
preprocessing.  It served as a baseline for the Hutter prize.  Details are
in the source code comments.

<p>paq8g (Przemyslaw Skibinski, Mar. 3, 2006) adds back WRT text preprocessing.

<p>paq8h (Alexander Rhatushnyak, Mar. 24, 2006) added additional contexts
to the neural network mixer.  It was top ranked on enwik9 (but not enwik8)
when the Hutter prize was launched on Aug. 6, 2006.  This is the 78'th version
since p5.

<p><a href=http://cilibrar.com/projsup/hutter/>raq8g</a> by Rudi Cilibrasi,
released 0721Z Aug. 16, 2006, is a modification of paq8f.  It adds
a NestModel to model nesting of parenthesis and brackets.
The test below for -7 is based on
a Windows compile, <a href=raq8g.exe>raq8g.exe</a>.
The test for -8 was under Linux.  The unzipped Linux executable is 27,660 bytes.

<p><a href=http://ilovemyking.googlepages.com/paqpage>paq8j</a> by Bill Pettis,
Nov. 13, 2006, is based on paq8f (no dictionary) with model improvements taken
from paq8hp5.  It is a general purpose compressor like paq8f, not specialized for text.

<p><a href=paq8ja.zip>paq8ja.zip</a> by Serge Osnach, Nov. 16, 2006, is an improvement
of paq8j, using additional contexts based on character classifications.

<p><a href=paq8jb.zip>paq8jb.zip</a> by Serge Osnach, Nov. 22, 2006, adds
contexts using the distance to an anchor byte (x00, space, newline, xff)
combined with previous characters.  
The -8 test caused some minor disk thrashing at 2 GB
memory under WinXP Home (82% CPU usage).  Time reported is wall time.

<p><a href=paq8jc.zip>paq8jc.zip</a> by Serge Osnach, Nov. 28, 2006, improves the
record model for better compression of some binary files, although it is
slightly worse for text.  Time for -8 is wall time at 72% CPU usage.

<p><a href=paq8jd.zip>paq8jd</a> by
<a href=http://ilovemyking.googlepages.com/paqpage>Bill Pettis</a>,
Dec. 30, 2006, improves on paq8j with additional SSE (APM) stages.
enwik8 -8 caused some disk thrashing at 2 GB memory.

<p><a href=http://ilovemyking.googlepages.com/paq8k.zip>paq8k</a> is by
Bill Pettis, Feb. 13, 2007.

<p><a href=paq8l.zip>paq8l</a> by
Matt Mahoney, Mar. 8, 2007, is based on paq8jd.  It adds a DMC model
and minor improvements.

<p><a href=paq8fthis2.zip>paq8fthis2</a>
by Jan Ondrus, Aug. 12, 2007, is paq8f with an improved model for compressing JPEG
images.  It is otherwise archive compatible with paq8f for data without JPEG images (such as
enwik8 and enwik9).

<p><a href=paq8n.zip>paq8n</a> by Matt Mahoney,
Aug. 18, 2007, combines paq8l with the JPEG model from paq8fthis2.

<p><a href=paq8o.zip>paq8o and paq8osse</a> by
Andreas Morphis, Aug 22 2007, is paq8n with an improved model for .bmp images.
There are two executables that produce identical archives.  paq8o.exe is for
Pentium MMX or higher.  paq8osse.exe is for newer processors that support SSE2 instructions
like the Pentium 4.  It is about 8% faster, but uses more memory.
Both use the same C++ source but use
different (but equivalent) assembler code to implement the neural network mixer.
paq8osse.exe was compiled with Intel C++, which produces slightly faster executables than
g++ used in earlier versions.  The current version is
<a href=paq8o2.zip>paq8o ver. 2</a> (Aug. 24, 2007),
which fixes the file name extension (was .paq8n) but does not change compression.
The benchmark is based on the first version.

<p><a href=paq8o3.zip>paq8o3</a> by KZ, Sept. 11, 2007, 
combines paq8o with an improved JPEG model from paq8fthis3 (Jan Ondrus, Sept. 8, 2007)
and an improved model for grayscale PGM images from paq8i
(Pavel Holoborodko, Aug. 18, 2006).  Text compression is unchanged from paq8l, paq8m,
paq8o, or paq8o2.

<p><a href=http://code.google.com/p/paq8/source>paq8o4 v1</a> by KZ, Sept. 15, 2007,
includes a grayscale .bmp model (based on the grayscale PGM model).  Text compression
is unaffected.  It was compiled with Intel C++.
<a href=paq8o4v2.zip>paq8o4 v2</a> by
Matt Mahoney, Sept. 17, 2007,
is a port to g++ which allows wildcards, directory traversal, and directory creation,
but is 8% slower.  It is archive compatible with v1.

<p><a href=paq8o6.zip>paq8o6</a> by KZ,
Sept. 28, 2007, is based
on <a href=paq8o5.zip>paq8o5</a> by KZ,
Sept. 21, 2007 with the improved JPEG model from 
<a href=paq8fthis4.zip>paq8fthis4</a>
by Jan Ondrus, Sept. 27, 2007.  paq8o5 is paq8o4 with an improved StateMap
from lpaq1.  The improved compression of enwik8 comes from this StateMap.
Compression of enwik8 is unchanged from paq8o5 to paq8o6.

<p><a href=paq8o7.zip>paq8o7</a> by
KZ, Oct. 16, 2007, improves paq8o6 with improved JPEG compression and support
for 4 and 8 bit BMP images.  Text is not affected.

<p><a href=paq8o8.zip>paq8o8</a> by
KZ, Oct. 23, 2007, improves paq8o7 with improved JPEG compression further.

<p><a href=paq8o8z-jun7.zip>paq8o8-jun7</a>
is a DOS port of paq8o8 by Rugxulo, June 7, 2008.

<a href=http://www.encode.ru/forum/showthread.php?t=342>(source code and discussion)</a>
was by Jan Ondrus (with contributions from many others),
June 20, 2009, and speed optimized by LovePimple on July 11, 2009.
By default the turbo version
runs in high priority under Windows, but was tested at normal priority.
The v60 version was released after a long period of development beginning with v1
on Apr. 25, 2009. Development was aimed mostly at improving x86,
image and wav compression. Decompression was not verified.

<p><a href=http://dhost.info/paq8/>paq8px_v69</a> was released
Apr. 26, 2010.

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1464-Paq8pxd-dict>
paq8pxd</a> by kaitz, Jan. 21, 2012,
modifies paq8px_v69 by adding dynamic dictionary preprocessing
(based on XWRT), UTF-8 detection, and an alternating byte sparse model.

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1464-Paq8pxd-dict?p=28321#post28321>
paq8pxd_v2</a> by kaitz (KZo) was released Feb. 11, 2012.

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/attachment.php?attachmentid=1855&d=1330038239>
paq8pxd_v3</a> by kaitz (KZo) was released Feb. 23, 2012. Modified im8model,
base64 in email model, and fixes false image detection in enwik9.

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/attachment.php?attachmentid=1930&d=1334855042>
paq8pxd_v4</a> by kaitz was released Apr. 19, 2012. Adds 4 bit bmp model,
base64 fixes, combines WRT source code and has other fixes.

<p>Options select memory usage as shown in the table.  Early versions took no options.
Most versions were not tested on enwik9 due to their slow speed.

<h3>.1440 drt|lpaq9m</h3>

<p>lpaq versions 1 through 8 may be downloaded <a href=index.html#lpaq>here</a>.
lpaq9* can be downloaded <a href=http://binet.com.ua/~artest/paqar/>here</a>
or as a <a href=lpaq9.zpaq>zpaq archive</a>.
The decompr8 series of Hutter prize entries (decompresser and enwik8 archive) are also
listed here because they followed a period of development of the lpaq series.

<p>Note: some of these programs are compressed
with upack, which compresses better than upx. Some virus detectors
give false alarms on all upack-compressed executables. The programs
are not infected.

<p><a href=lpaq1.zip>lpaq1</a> is a free,
open source (GPL) file compressor by Matt Mahoney, July 24, 2007.  It uses context mixing.
It is a "lite" version of paq8l, about 35 times faster at the cost of about
10% in compression.  The "9" option selects maximum memory.  The options
range from 0 (6 MB) to 9 (1.5 GB).  Memory usage is 3 + 3*2<sup>N</sup> MB,
N = 0..9.

<p>The compressor mixes 7 contexts: orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, a unigram word context
(consecutive letters, case insensitive), and a matched bit context.  The contexts
(except the matched bit) are mapped to nonstationary bit histories using
nibble-aligned hash tables, then mapped to bit prediction
probabilities using stationary adaptive tables with bit counts to control adaptation rate. 
The matched bit context maps the predicted bit (based on a context match), 
match length and order-1 context (or order 0 if no match) to a bit prediction.
The probabilities are combined
in the logistic domain (log(p/(1-p)) using a single layer neural network selected
by a small context (3 high bits of last byte + context order), then passed through
2 SSE stages (orders 0 and 1) and arithmetic coded.  Except for one model for
ASCII text, there are no specialized models for binary data, .exe, .bmp, .jpeg, etc.

<p><a href=lpaq2.zip>lpaq2</a> by
Alexander Rhatushnyak, Sept. 20, 2007, contains some speed optimizations.

<p><a href=http://schnaader.info/>lprepaq 1.2</a> by Christian Schnaader, Sept. 29, 2007,
is lpaq1 combined with precomp as a preprocessor.  precomp compresses JPEG files
and also expands data segments compressed with zlib, often making them more
compressible.  This preprocessing has no effect on text files.

<p><a href=lpaq3.zip>lpaq3 and elpaq3</a> by
Alexander Rhatushnyak, Sept. 29, 2007, has two versions with the same source
code.  When compiled with
-DWIKI, the result is elpaq3 which is tuned for large text files.  The normal
compile produces lpaq3.

<p><a href=lpaq3a.zip>lpaq3a</a> by
Alexander Rhatushnyak, Sept. 30, 2007, improves compression on some files
over lpaq3 (but not enwik8/9).  The archive also contains lpaq3e.exe, which is
an archive compatible (Intel compile) of elpaq3.exe.

<p><a href=http://binet.com.ua/~artest/paqar/lpaq4.zip>lpaq4 and lpaq4e</a>
(<a href=lpaq4.zip>mirror</a>)
are by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Oct. 1, 2007.  lpaq4e is tuned for large text files.

<p><a href=lpaq5.zip>lpaq5 and lpaq5e</a>
are by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Oct. 16, 2007.  Option 9 selects 1542 MB memory.  
lpaq5e is tuned for large text files.  It includes separate programs
for compression only (lpaq5e-c.exe) and decompression only (lpaq5e-d.exe).
Tests were done with these programs, rather
than the version that does both (lpaq5e.exe).

<p><a href=lpaq6.zip>lpaq6 and lpaq6e</a>
are by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Oct. 22, 2007.  Option 9 selects 1542 MB memory.
lpaq6e is tuned for large text files.  lpaq6 includes a E8E9 transform for
compressing x86 executables.

<p><a href=http://www.binet.com.ua/~artest/paqar/?M=D>lpaq7 and lpaq7e</a>
<a href=lpaq7.zip>(mirror)</a>
are by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Oct. 31, 2007.

<p><a href=lpaq8.zip>lpaq8 and lpaq8e</a>
are by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Dec. 10, 2007.  The executables are packed with upack.
zip -9 would make them larger.

<p><a href=lpaq1a.zip>lpaq1a</a> by
Matt Mahoney, Dec. 21, 2007, uses the same model as lpaq1 but replaces the
arithmetic coder with the asymmetric binary coder from fpaqb.

<p><a href=lpq1.zip>lpq1</a> by
Matt Mahoney, Dec. 23, 2007, is an archiver (not a file compressor) based
on lpaq1 option 7.

<p><a href=http://binet.com.ua/~artest/paqar/lpaq9e.zip>drt|lpaq9e</a>
is by
Alexander Rhatushnyak, Feb. 20, 2008.  It is specialized for English text.
It includes a separate program drt.exe (without source code) which performs
a dictionary transform prior to compression with lpaq9e.  The option 9 is
for lpaq9e which selects maximum memory.  The program size is computed by adding
lpaq9e.exe, drt.exe, and the compressed dictionary, which must be uncompressed
with lpaq9e before running.  The size is smaller without a zip archive.
Decompression consists of uncompressing the dictionary with lpaq9e,
uncompressing the transformed file with lpaq9e, and reversing the transform
with drt.  Run times are for the sum of all three operations
(1+62+2943, 1+2929+45 sec).

<p><a href=http://binet.com.ua/~artest/paqar/lpaq9f.zip>lpaq9f</a> by
Alexander Rasushnyak, Apr. 27, 2007, works like lpaq9e.  Run times are
(2+55+2801, 2+2819+38 sec). drt uses 8 MB for compression and 4 MB
for decompression.

<p><a href=http://binet.com.ua/~artest/paqar/lpaq9g.zip>lpaq9g</a> by
Alexander Rasushnyak, May 23, 2008, works like lpaq9e.  Run times are
(2+51+2691, 2+2682+38 sec).  

<p><a href=http://binet.com.ua/~artest/paqar/lpaq9h.zip>lpaq9h</a> by
Alexander Rasushnyak, June 3, 2008, works like lpaq9e.  Run times are
(2+53+2530, 2+2529+44 sec).

<p>lpaq9i by
Alexander Rasushnyak, June 13, 2008, works like lpaq9e.  Run times are
(2+59+2425, 2+2453+46 sec).  drt.exe and the dictionary file
(tmpdict0.dic) are unchanged in all versions starting with lpaq9f.

<p><a href=http://www.binet.com.ua/~artest/paqar/lpaq9j.zip>lpaq9j</a>
by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Aug. 17, 2008, has a new version of drt.exe and
dictionary. Run times are (2+58+2365, 2+2358+48 sec).

<p><a href=http://www.binet.com.ua/~artest/paqar/lpaq9k.zip>lpaq9k</a>
is by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Sept. 30, 2008. Run times are (2+59+2336,
2+2346+47 sec). decompresser size is as 3 files (not zipped).

<p><a href=http://www.binet.com.ua/~artest/paqar/lpaq9l.zip>lpaq9l</a>
is by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Dec. 2, 2008. Run times are (2+41+2132,
2+2179+40 sec) on the computer described in note 26, and
(2+58+2338, 2+2422+50) on the computer used to test all the earlier versions.
decompresser size is as 3 files (not zipped).

<p><a href=http://artst.narod.ru/b/lpaq9m.zip>lpaq9m</a>
<a href=lpaq9m.zpaq>(zpaq archive)</a>
is by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Feb. 20, 2009. Run times are
(2+38+2067, 2+2111+38). decompresser size is 3 files (not zipped).

<p><a href=decomp8.zpaq>decomp8</a> is a Hutter
Prize entry by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Mar. 23, 2009. It consists of a
decompresser (Windows executable only) and an archive (archive8.bin) which
decompresses to enwik8. There is no compressor. During decompression, the
program creates a temporary file containing a dictionary similar to the one
used in paq8hp12 and by drt. The command to decompress is "decomp8 archive8.bin enwik8".
The total size (not zipped) is 15,986,677 bytes.

<p><a href=decomp8b.zpaq>decomp8b</a> is
an update to the Hutter prize entry
decomp8 by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Apr. 22, 2009. Total size
(not zipped) is 15,958,674 bytes.

<p><a href=decmprs8.zpaq>decmprs8</a> is
an update to the Hutter prize entry
decomp8b by Alexander Ratushyak, May 23, 2009. Total size
(not zipped) is 15,949,688 bytes. To decompress: decmprs8.exe archive8.dat enwik8

<p>drt may be combined with other compressors to improve compression.
The following were obtained using drt and tmpdict0.dic (from lpaq9i)
with ppmonstr J (PPM).  Option -m1650 selects 1650 MB memory. -r1 partially
rebuilds the model when memory is exhausted. -o select the PPM model order.
Compression time is for ppmonstr only. Mem8 is actual memory used to compress
enwik8.drt.  enwik9.drt always uses 1650 MB.  As a separate compressor, the
compressor size would be 147,915 for a zip file containing drt.exe, ppmonstr.exe,
and tmpdict0.pmm (tmpdict0.dic compressed with ppmonstr -m1650 -r1 -o64).
Total size would be 148,047,289.

<p>For drt 9j, the decompresser size is 149,468 and total size is 147,196,757.

<p>The following shows the effects of drt from lpaq9m on enwik8. The first numeric
column is the compressed size of enwik8. The second is the compressed size of
the uncompressed dictionary (lpqdict0.dic, 465,210 bytes) concatentated with
enwik8.drt (61,289,634 bytes) using compressor versions that were current as of
June 26, 2010 unless indicated. The ratio shows the improvement due to preprocessing.
The dictionary contains 44880 lowercase words. DRT replaces word occurrences with
codes of 1 to 3 bytes and uses codes to indicate capitalized words or letters.

<h3>.1494 zpaq</h3>

<a href=.>zpaq</a> 1.03 is a free, open source command line archiver
by Matt Mahoney, Sept. 8, 2009. zpaq implements the proposed ZPAQ
standard format for highly compressed data. The goal of the standard
is to allow the development of new compression algorithms without
breaking compatibility with older decompressers. ZPAQ is
described by the <a href=zpaq.pdf>level 1 specification</a> and a
<a href=unzpaq103.cpp>reference decoder</a>. The specification does
not describe the encoding algorithm. It only requires that compressed
files be readable by the reference decoder, which was first released
with the standard on Mar. 12, 2009 (v1.00). The release followed
a development period with 9 experimental and
incompatible version (level 0, v0.01 through v0.09) released
beginning Feb. 15, 2009.
All level 1 versions from v1.00 onward are forward and backward compatible
with each other. Higher levels may be introduced in the future with
only a forward compatibility requirement: higher level decompressers
must read archives produced by lower level compressors, back to level 1.

<p>A ZPAQ archive is organized into independently compressed blocks.
Each block is divided into one or more segments which must be
decompressed in sequence. Each segment represents a file or a part
of a file. The standard supports both archivers and single file
compressors. In the case of a compressor, no filenames are stored
in the segment headers,
and all the blocks and segments are concatenated to a single output
file specified by the user.

<p>ZPAQ uses a streaming format that
can be read or written in a single pass. The arithmetic coded data
is designed so that the end of a segment can be found by scanning
quickly without decoding. There is no central directory
information to update when blocks are added, removed, or reordered.

<p>The ZPAQ standard requires that the decompression algorithm be
described in the block headers. The header describes a collection
of bitwise predictive models based loosely on PAQ components, a
program to compute the bytewise contexts for each model, and a second
program to perform arbitrary postprocessing on the output data.
The two programs are written in an interpreted bytecode language
called ZPAQL.

<p>A ZPAQ model specifies a list of 1 to 255 components. Each
component outputs a prediction or probability that the next bit
will be a 1. Each component may receive as input a computed
32-bit context and the output predictions of earlier components on the list.
The last component's prediction is fed to an arithmetic coder to
encode or decode the next bit. The components are as follows:
<ul>
<li>CONST - specifies a fixed, constant prediction.
<li>CM - context model. The context is mapped to a prediction
 by a table with a user specified size. Each table entry also
 has a count. The table is updated by adjusting the prediction
 to reduce the prediction error in proportion to 1/count. The
 count is incremented up to a user specified limit in the range
 4 to 1020.
<li>ICM - indirect context model. The context is mapped to a bit
 history (an 8 bit state) by a hash table of user specified size.
 The history is mapped to a prediction by a CM with a fixed, high
 count limit. The history represents a count of recent 0 and 1 bits
 and also indicates whether the last bit was a 0 or 1.
<li>MATCH - has an output buffer and pointer table, both of user specified
 size. The context is mapped to a pointer into the buffer where the
 same context was last observed. The corresponding bit after the
 last match is predicted in proportion to the length of the match.
<li>AVG - Two predictions are combined by weighted averaging. The
 user specifies the weight. Weighted mixing is always in the logistic
 or "stretched" domain: stretch(p) = log(p/(1-p)).
<li>MIX2 - Two stretched predictions are combined by weighted averaging from
 a table of weights of a user specified size and selected by a
 context. After prediction, the selected weight is updated to
 favor the more accurate input prediction. The user specifies
 the adaptation rate.
<li>MIX - Like a MIX2 but over a user specified array of
 earlier predictions and one weight per input per context.
<li>SSE - secondary symbol estimation. A context and a stretched
 input prediction
 select an output prediction from two adjacent entries in a 2-D table
 by interpolation. The table is updated to reduce the prediction
 error of the nearer of the two entries as with a CM. The user specifies
 the table size in the context dimension (the probability dimension is
 fixed at 64), and the initial and maximum counts to determine adaptation
 rate.
<li>ISSE - indirect SSE. Receives a context and an earlier prediction.
 The context is mapped to a bit history as with an ICM. The history
 is mapped to the context of a MIX2 with one prediction from input
 and the other CONST. It has the effect of adjusting the input prediction
 based on the bit history of the current context.
</ul>

<p>There are two ZPAQL virtual machines, one (HCOMP) to compute contexts,
and one (PCOMP) to postprocess the decoded data. Each program is called once
per decoded byte with that byte as input. A ZPAQL machine has the following state:
<ul>
<li>An array H of 32 bit unsigned values of user specified size. In HCOMP, the
 elements at the beginning of the array are each assigned to a
 component to hold its context.
<li>An array M of 8 bit unsigned values of user specified size.
<li>32 bit registers A, B, C, and D. A is the accumulator, the destination
 of most arithmetic and logical operations. It also contains the input byte
 when the program is executed. B and C can point into M.
 D can point into H.
<li>256 registers, R0 through R255, holding 32 bit values.
<li>A flag register F holding the result of the last comparison (true or false).
<li>A 16 bit program counter.
</ul>
Most instructions are either 1 byte or 2 bytes with an 8 bit operand
(0..255). There is one 3 byte instruction (16 bit jump). The possible
instructions are assignment, swap, add, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, and,
or, xor, not-and, left shift, right shift, less than, equals, greater than,
increment, decrement, complement, jump, conditional jump, hash, output,
and halt. The hash instruction is convenient for updating a context
hash with an input byte by the formula hash := (hash + byte + 512) * 773.

<p>zpaq 1.03 takes as input a configuration file which describes the
arrangement of components, their parameters, and the ZPAQL program HCOMP
written one token per byte in a C-like syntax (e.g. "A=B" to assign
B to A). PCOMP is not specified because in general the preprocessing step
by the compressor is different (and usually more complex) than the
postprocessing step. Instead, zpaq 1.03 provides the
option of two built-in preprocessors, LZP and E8E9. If selected, the
preprocessing is done in C++ by the compressor, and the compressor
generates ZPAQL code to perform the inverse transform and insert it
into the archive block header. (PCOMP is actually appended to the beginning
of the input data and compressed with it. HCOMP is not compressed).

<p>E8E9 is used to improve compression of 32 bit x86 executable files.
It replaces the 32 bit relative address after a CALL or JMP (0xE8 or 0xE9)
x86 instruction
by adding the offset from the beginning of the file. This improves
compression because often there are several calls to the same target.
PCOMP performs the inverse transform in ZPAQL by subtracting the offset.

<p>LZP encodes long string matches as an escape byte and length byte.
The decompresser maintains a rolling context hash which indexes
a pointer table (the H array) into the output buffer (the M array)
pointing to the previous context match. If an escape is present, then
the indicated number of bytes are copied from the previous context
match. In zpaq 1.03, the user can specify the sizes of M and H, the
hash multiplier (effectively choosing the context length), the
value to use as the escape byte (preferably occurring rarely in the
input), and minimum match length. Escape bytes in the input are
encoded as an escaped 0 length.

<p>zpaq 1.03 is distributed with three configuration files,
min.cfg (for speed), mid.cfg (the default), and max.cfg (for good
compression). However, the user can also write their own config files.

<p><a href=o0.cfg>o0.cfg</a>, <a href=o1.cfg>o1.cfg</a>, and
<a href=o2.cfg>o2.cfg</a> are order 0, 1, and 2 models with a single
CM and direct context lookup with no hashing. o0 is equivalent
to fpaq0. In each of the models the asymptotic learning rate
was tuned for maximum compression. Other values are given as
comments in the sources. The CM uses 2KB, 512KB and 128MB respectively.

<p>min.cfg uses LZP preprocessing with a minimum match length
of 3 and an order 4 context hash, followed by compression by single CM
with an order 3 context and 512K entries. The LZP has a 1 MB output buffer and
256K index. It uses 4 MB memory.

<p>mid.cfg (the default) does no preprocessing.
It has an order 0 ICM, a chain of ISSE with
context orders 1 through 5, each taking the previous ISSE as input,
a MATCH with an order 7 context, and a final MIX with an order 1
context taking input from all other models. It uses 111 MB memory.

<p>max.cfg does no preprocessing. It has 21 components: an order 0 ICM,
a chain of order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 ISSE, an order 8 MATCH, a wordwise
order 0-1 ICM-ISSE chain (for text),
sparse order 1 ICM with gaps of 1, 2, and 3,
a partially masked order 2 ICM with a gap of 216 for CCITT images
(calgary/pic), order 0 and 1 mixers taking a CONST and all previous components
as input and averaged together with a context free MIX2, followed by
a chain of
order 0 and 1 SSE each partially bypassed by a context free and order 0
MIX2, and a final context free MIX of all other components.
The two wordwise contexts depend on the current and previous case insensitive
sequences of letters in the range a-z. It uses 278 MB memory.

<p><a href=max3.cfg>max3.cfg</a> is a variation of max.cfg by Jan Ondrus
(Sept. 10, 2009) using 550 MB memory and without a CCITT model.

<p><a href=max4.cfg>max4.cfg</a> is a variation of max3.cfg
(Sept. 15, 2009) using 1465 MB memory.

<p>drt is the dictionary preprocessor from lpaq9m by Alexander Rasushnyak.
The results include the dictionary file lpqdict0.dic
compressed from 465,210 to 88,759 bytes in 8 seconds
as a separate archive with max4.cfg and decompressed in 7 seconds, and
drt.exe with a size of 15,548 bytes (whether uncompressed or as a zip file)
with 38 seconds to encode enwik9 and 38 seconds to decode.

<p><a href=max_enwik9.cfg>max_enwik9.cfg</a> is a variation of max.cfg
by Mike Russell, Sept. 11, 2009. It adds 5 more models for higher order
contexts using an ISSE chain after the first order 5 mixer.

<p><a href=max_enwik9drt.cfg>max_enwik9drt.cfg</a> is a variation of
max_enwik9.cfg, Sept. 18, 2009, modified to define word contexts
for ASCII range 65-255 instead of A-Z,a-z because DRT encodes words
using bytes in the range 128-255. The compressed size of lpqdict0.dic
is 86810 bytes, 12+9 sec, compressed separately and added to the
compressed sizes.

<p><a href=zpipe100.zip>zpipe 1.00</a> is a ZPAQ compatible streaming
file compressor that compresses or decompresses from standard input
to standard output. It takes no options.
It compresses equivalently to mid.cfg without storing
a filename or comment. The decompresser outputs the contents of archives
to a single file by concatenation.

<p><a href=bwt_j2.zip>bwt_j2.cfg</a> implements an inverse BWT transform.
It was writen by Jan Ondrus, Oct. 6, 2009. The forward transform is
implemented by an external preprocessor, bwtpre (included above) by
Matt Mahoney, Oct. 6, 2009. bwtpre is based on BBB fast mode compression
but does not itself compress. The argument ",18" tells bwt_j2.cfg to use a
block size of 2<sup>10+18</sup>-256 bytes. Memory usage is 5x blocksize for both
the preprocessor and postprocessor, plus 100 MB for the model.
The ability of config files to call external
preprocessors was added to zpaq v1.05 on Sept. 28, 2009. The ability
to pass arguments was added to zpaq v1.07 on Oct. 2, 2009.

<p><a href=zpaq108.zip>zpaq v1.08</a> (Oct. 14, 2009)
adds the capability to compile
ZPAQL configuration files and corresponding archive headers to C++ and
link to a copy of itself to speed up compression and decompression.
The program first looks for an optimized version of the program,
writes and compiles it if needed, then runs it to compress or decompress.
Some tests are shown for speed comparison. max.cfg was modified to
use less memory. 
The arguments to min.cfg, mid.cfg, and max.cfg have the effect of improving
compression at the cost of doubling memory for each increment.

<p><a href=bwt_slowmode1.zip>bwt_slowmode1_1GB_block.cfg</a> implements
slow mode BWT transform using 1.25x blocksize memory based on BBB.
The inverse transform was re-implemented in ZPAQL by Jan Ondrus,
Oct. 15, 2009.

<p><a href=zpaq109.zip>zpaq v1.09</a> is mainly a Linux port of v1.08 with some
cosmetic improvements. Times for obwt_j2.cfg,18 are shown for comparison
to v1.07 without optimization. Memory usage is 1838 MB for compression
(includes preprocessor) and 1443 MB for decompression.

<p>The c command followed by the name of a configuration file
creates a new archive using that file. By default the archive
header includes the file name (6 bytes), size (10 bytes), and
SHA1 checksum (20 bytes). There are options to omit these and save
36 bytes. The "oc" command in zpaq v1.08 optimizes for speed.

<p><a href=zp100.zip>zp 1.00</a> is a ZPAQ compatible archiver by
Matt Mahoney, May 7, 2010. It is designed to have fewer options so it is
easier to use. It has 3 compression levels: 1=fast, 2=mid, 3=max.
It uses compiled ZPAQL code (like zpaq oc/ox) but without requiring
an external C++ compiler to be installed. It automatically detects when
an archive is compressed with one of these three models and decompresses
with compiled code. Otherwise, it will decompress all other ZPAQ compatible
archives with slower, interpreted code.
Levels 2 and 3 are the same as zpaq mid.cfg and max.cfg.
Only level 1 (fast) was tested because
it uses a new model, <a href=fast.cfg>fast.cfg</a>, an ICM chain of length
2 with order 2 and 4 contexts. It is equivalent to compressing with
zpaq ocfast.cfg.

<p><a href=http://mattmahoney.net/dc/zpaq.html>pzpaq</a> 0.01
(a predecessor to zp 1.02) is a free, open source
file compressor and archiver by Matt Mahoney, Jan. 21, 2011. It uses a ZPAQ compatible
format with speed optimizations for the 3 default compression levels supported by libzpaq,
zpaq, and zpipe. It supports parallel compression and decompression by dividing the
input into blocks which are compressed or decompressed
at the same time in separate threads, writing
the result to temporary files, and then comcatenating them when done.
For compression with N threads,
the input is divided into N blocks of equal size by default, although a different block
size can be specified.
Larger blocks make compression better but reduce the number of threads that can
run at the same time. Using more threads also increases the memory required.
pzpaq can also compress
or decompress multiple files at once to separate archives or pack them into a solid
archive or an archive with the packed files split across blocks within the archive.

<p>The version 0.01 distribution includes a 32 bit Windows executable and source code
to compile for Windows or Linux. For Windows, the code must be linked with
<a href=http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/>Pthreads-Win32</a> and pthreadGC2.dll
is required at run time.
The program size was calculated from the source code (including libzpaq)
required for Linux, which has pthreads installed by default and is not included in
the size.

<p>The test results shown below are for 2 machines, a 2.67 GHz
Intel Core i7 M620 with 2 cores
and 2 hyperthreads per core, running 64 bit Linux (note 48),
and a 2.0 GHz Intel T3200 with 2 cores without hyperthreading
running 32 bit Windows (note 26).
The Linux version was compiled with g++ 4.4.4 -O3 -s -march=native -DNDEBUG.
The Windows version used the distributed pzpaq.exe and pthreadGC2.dll.
It was compiled with g++ 4.5.0 -O2 -s -march=pentiumpro -fomit-frame-pointer.
Times shown are wall (real) times, not process times, in nanoseconds per byte.

<p>We observe the normal 3 way tradeoff between speed, memory, and compression.
Compression levels -1, -2, and -3 require
38 MB, 112 MB, and 247 MB per thread respectively. The default is -2.
-t selects the number of threads. The default is -t2.
-b selects the block size. The default is the input size divided by
the number of threads.
The -m option limits memory usage in MB by reducing -t. The default
is -m500. Selecting larger -m than required has no effect on
compression, speed, or actual memory used. -m is only required
with -3 -t3 or higher.

<a href=http://mattmahoney.net/dc/zpaq.html#zp>zp 1.02</a> is a successor
to pzpaq, which was considered experimental. It adds two new BWT compression
modes which replace the "fast" (-1) model. Option -m1 selects the faster
BWT mode (bwtrle1), which consists of right-context sorting
(using libdivsufsoft by Yuta
Mori), RLE encoding, and a single order 0 ICM with the RLE state (literal
or count) as context. The BWT output is run length encoded by replacing
runs of 2 to 257 identical bytes with 2 bytes and a count. The ICM maps
the context to a bit history and then to a bit prediction, which is
adjusted after coding to reduce the prediction error.

<p>Option -m2 selects the better BWT mode (bwt2), which drops the RLE step and
uses an order 0-1 ISSE chain. The order-1 ISSE adjusts the order-0 ICM
prediction by mixing it in the logistic domain with a constant, such that
the pair of weights is selected by an 8-bit bit history, which is selected
by an order 1 context of the BWT output. After coding, the mixing weights
are adjusted to reduce the prediction error.

<p>Options -m3 and -m4 select the "mid" and "max" modes, the same as
-4 and -5 respectively in pzpaq. The option -bN selects a block size
of N*2^20 - 256 bytes. Memory usage per thread
for the two BWT modes is 5 times the block size after
rounding up to a power of 2. The default is -b32 which uses 160 MB per
thread for -m1 and -m2. Memory usage for -m3 and -m4 is not affected
by block size. Usage is 111 MB and 246 MB per thread for -m3 and -m4
respectively.

<p>Other changes: there is no longer an option to limit memory. The
default number of threads (-t option) is the number of cores. There is
no solid mode compression because BWT requires that each block contain
only one whole or part of a file. There is a separate decompresser, unzp,
which is optimized for fast, mid, max, bwtrle1, and bwt2 modes, and can
be configured to optimize for other models by generating, compiling,
linking, and running C++ code for an optimized version of itself.
Compressed sizes are based on the unzp source code (37,967 bytes).

<p><a href=../zpaq>zpaq 4.00</a> was released Nov. 13, 2011. It uses libzpaq v4.00,
which internally
translates ZPAQL into just-in-time (JIT) x86-32 or x86-64, which runs about as fast
as the previous version that translated ZPAQL to C++ and compiled it.
Unlike the earlier version, it correctly handles all legal ZPAQL, such as jumps into
the middle of a 2 byte instruction, such as occurs in max_enwik9.cfg.
Like zp 1.02, it uses multi-threading and the same build-in compression
levels -m1 through -m4.

<p>Results are shown below for a 4 GB 2.66 GHz Core I7 M620 (note 40), which has 2 cores
with 2 hyperthreads each. Run under Ubuntu 64 bit Linux. Compression and
decompression times (wall times, ns/byte) are shown for 1 through 4 threads
(-t1 through -t4) as the compression method (-m) and block size (-b) are
varied. max_enwik9 runs in one thread in a single block.

<p><a href=http://mattmahoney.net/dc/zpaq.html>zpaq</a>
<a href=http://mattmahoney.net/dc/zpaq612.zip>v6.12</a>, Oct. 19, 2012,
is a journaling, deduplicating, incremental archiver. These features were
added in zpaq v6.00 on Sept. 26, 2012.
It implements the level 2 ZPAQ standard introduced with libzpaq v5.00
on Feb. 1, 2012. The level 2 standard allows for uncompressed
(but possibly pre/post-processsed) data. The format is described
in the <a href=http://mattmahoney.net/dc/zpaq201.pdf>ZPAQ specification v2.01</a>.

<p>zpaq v6.12 is designed for large backups. It will compress 100 GB to an external
drive in a few hours, then perform daily incremental backups of files whose dates
have changed in a few minutes.
It recursively traverses directories, storing last-modified dates and attributes
of added files.

<p>A journaling archive is append-only.
When a journaling archive is updated, it keeps both the old and new
versions of each file or directory. The old version can be extracted by specifying
a dated version, and any later updates are ignored.

<p>Input is deduplicated before compression by dividing input files into fragments
averaging 64 KB on content-dependent boundaries that move when data is inserted or
removed. The archive stores fragment SHA-1 hashes and stores any fragment with a
matching hash as a pointer to an existing fragment.
Any remaining fragments are packed into 16 MB
blocks in memory and compressed by multiple threads in parallel to memory buffers
before being appended to the archive. After compression is completed, the fragment
sizes and hashes are appended, and then a list of index updates in separately
compressed blocks. Each update is either a deletion (filename only) or an update
(filename, date, attributes, and list of fragment pointers).

<p>An update is performed
as a transaction by first appending a temporary header, then the compressed data
and index, and then finally going back and updating the header to store the compressed
data size so that it can be skipped over when listing the archive contents or
preparing a list of files to add or extract. If compression is interrupted or
an error occurs, then the temporary header is not updated. If zpaq encounters a
temporary header then it assumes that any data following it is corrupted and ignores it
during extraction or listing, and overwrites it during the next update.

<p>zpaq also has features to summarize the contents of archives containing millions
of files, show update history and version dates, and compare and extract individual files
and directories and rename them. Archives can be encrypted.

<p>The deduplication algorithm uses a rolling hash of the input that depends on
the last 32 bytes that are not predicted in an order-1 context. Missed predictions
(from a 256 byte table) are counted as a heuristic to guess whether a block can
be compressed. If not, then it is stored without compression as a speed optimization.
There are 4 compression levels (-method 1 through 4). The threshold for compressing
a block is 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, and 1/128 of bytes predicted by the order 1 model,
respectively. Like earlier versions of zpaq, it also accepts configuration files
and external preprocessors. These are always compressed.

<p>The journaling format is not compatible with zpaq versions prior to 6.00. Older
versions would decompress a journaling archive to a set of jDC* files that could
in theory reconstruct the data. To support older versions, there are three additional
modes: streaming, solid, and tiny. In streaming mode, each file is compressed in
parallel in a separate block, and large files are split into 16 MB blocks. In
solid mode, all files are compressed to a single block in a single thread. Tiny
mode is like solid mode except that comments (uncompressed sizes), checksums, and
header locator tags (for error recovery) are not stored, saving a few bytes each.
None of these modes support journaling, incremental backup, or deduplication, and
do not save file attributes or empty directories. An update appends to an archive
without checking whether the files have been added before.

<p>There are 4 built in methods.
Method 1 is equivalent to "lazy" level 3. It is
LZ77 using variable length codes to represent the lengths
of literal byte strings or the length and offset of matches to
earlier occurrences of the same string in a 16 MB output block.
Matches are found by indexing a hash of the next 4 bytes in the
input buffer into a table of size 4M which is grouped into 512K
buckets of 8 pointers each. The longest match is coded, provided
the length is at least 4, or 5 if the offset is greater than 64K and the last
output was a literal. Ties are broken by favoring the smaller offset.
Bucket elements are selected for replacement using the low 3 bits
of the output count.

<p>Literal lengths are coded using "marked binary" Elias gamma codes,
where the leading
1 bit of the number is dropped and a 1 bit is inserted in front
of the remaining bits and a 0 marks the end. For example, 1100
is coded as 1,1,1,0,1,0,0. Matches are coded as a length and an
offset. The length is at least 4. All but the last 2 bits are
coded as a marked binary. The number of match bits is given in
the first 5 bits of the code. If the code starts with 00, then
a literal length and string of literal follow. Otherwise the 5
bits code a number from 0 to 23, and that number of bits, with
an implied leading 1 give the offset.

<p>The codes are not compressed further. They are stored in
the ZPAQ level 2 format, consisting of a sequence of sub-blocks
each preceded by a 4 byte header giving the sub-block size.

<p>Method 2 is also LZ77, but the codes are byte aligned and context
modeled rather than coded directly. It also searches 4 order-7
context hashes and 4 order-4 hashes, rather than 8 order-4 hashes
like method 1. Method 2 first codes as follows, according to the
high 2 bits of the first byte:
<pre>
  00 = literal of length 1..64, followed by uncompressed bytes.
  01 = match of length 4..11 and offset 1..2048.
  10 = match of length 1..64 and offset of 1..65536.
  11 = match of length 1..64 and offset of 1..16777216.
</pre>
These codes are arithmetic coded using an indirect context model. The
context depends on the parse state and in the case of literals, on the
previous byte. An indirect context model maps a context into
a bit history (represented as an 8 bit state) and then to a bit
prediction. The model is updated by adjusting the prediction
to reduce the error by 0.1%. A bit history represents a bounded
pair of bit counts (n0,n1) and the value of the most recent bit.
The bounds for (n0,n1) and (n1,n0) are (20,0), (48,1), (15,2),
(8,3), (6,4), (5,5).

<p>Method 3 uses a Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) using
libdivsufsort-lite v2.0. This is equivalent to -m2 in older
zpaq versions. The input bytes
are sorted by their right contexts and compressed using an
order 0-1 ICM-ISSE chain. The order 0 ICM (indirect context
model) works as in method 2, taking only the previous bits of
the current byte (MSB first) as context. The prediction is
adjusted by an order-1 indirect secondary symbol estimator (ISSE).
An ISSE maps its context (the previous byte and the leading
bits of the current byte) to a bit history, and the history
selects a pair of mixing weights to compute the weighted average
of the constant 1 and the ICM output in the logistic domain,
log(p/(1-p)). The output is converted back to linear, and the
two weights are updated to reduce the prediction error in favor
of the better model. In other words, the output is:
<pre>
  p' := 1/(1 + exp(-w1*1 - w2*log(p/(1-p))))
</pre>
and after the bit is arithmetic coded, the weights w1 and w2 are updated:
<pre>
  w1 := w1 + 1            * 0.001 * (bit - p')
  w2 := w2 + log(p/(1-p)) * 0.001 * (bit - p')
</pre>

<p>Method 4 is equivalent to mid.cfg or -m3 in older zpaq versions.
It directly models the data using an order 0-5 ICM-ISSE chain,
an order 7 match model, and an order 1 mixer which produces the bit
prediction by mixing the predictions of all other components. The 6
components in the chain each mix the next lower order prediction using a
hash of the next higher order context to select a bit history for that
context, which selects the mixing weights. A match model has a 16 MB
history buffer and a 4M hash table of the previous occurrence of the
current context. If a match is found, it predicts the bit that followed
the match with probability 1 - 1/(length in bits). The outputs of
all 7 models are then mixed as with an ISSE except with a vector of
7 weights selected by an order 1 (16 bit) context, and with a faster
weight update rate of about 0.01.

<p>With method 4 you can give an argument like "-method 4 1" to double
the memory allocated to the components to improve compression. The
same extra memory is needed to decompress. The default is 111 MB
per thread. An argument n multiplies memory usage by 2^n. n can be negative.

<p>Methods 1, 2, and 3 only work in journaling and streaming mode, since
they have a 16 MB block size limit. Method 4 and configuration files work in all modes.

<p>The following tests are on a 2.0 GHz T3200 with 2 cores. zpaq will automatically
detect the number of cores and use the same number of compression or
decompression threads, although this can be overridden.

<h3>.1500 nanozip</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.nanozip.net/>nanozip</a> 0.01a is a free, experimental,
closed source GUI and command line archiver by Sami Runsas, July 14, 2008.
For these tests, the command line version (smaller executable) was used. It compresses
using several algorithms (fastest to best): LZP (options -cf and -cF), LZ77
(-cd, -cD), BWT (-co, -cO, uses 5N block size)
and CM (-cc). The uppercase options (-cF, -cD, -cO) compress
better but slower than the corresponding lowercase options and may use more memory.
The default compression mode is -co (fast BWT).
-m1500m selects 1500 MB memory, although the reported memory usage may differ and
the actual memory usage (Cmem, Dmem, in MB)
measured with Task Manager is usually lower than reported.
The program will use less memory depending on available physical memory when run.
-forcemem was used to override this.
For all tests, -nm was used to turn off checksums and not store timestamps or file
permissions. For -cO, the program uses a LZ77 variant (called LZT)
instead of BWT for binary files. -txt is an optimization for text files with -co or -cO.

<p>nanozip 0.03a was released July 31, 2008. Only -cc was tested.

<p>nanozip 0.05a was released Oct. 20, 2008. Options are as in 0.01a and include
-nm -forcemem.

<p>nanozip 0.06a was released Feb. 13, 2009. Options are as in 0.01a and include
-nm -forcemem. w32c creates a self extracting archive (.exe file).

<p>nanozip 0.08a was released June 3, 2010. _64 refers to the Windows 64 bit version.
w32c means to produce a self extracting archive. -nm means do not store
metadata or redundancy information. -cc selects a context mixing model.
-m2.6g means use 2.6 GB memory. enwik8 was tested with -m2g (uses 1670 MB).

<p>nanozip 0.09a was released Nov. 4, 2011. Option w32c selects a self extracting
archive, so the decompresser size is 0. Option -p4 runs multithreaded compression
on 4 processors. Tested under 64 bit Linux.

<h3>.1512 xwrt</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.ii.uni.wroc.pl/~inikep/research/XML/XML-WRT20.zip>xml-wrt 2.0</a>
is a free command line file compressor with source available, by Przemyslaw Skibinski,
June 19, 2006.  It uses LZMA (LZ77 + arithmetic coding) with preprocessing for modeing text,
XML tags, dates, and numbers.  It may also be used as a preprocessor for input
to other compressors.  Version 1.0 was strictly a preprocessor without built-in compression.

<p>The -l6 option selects maximum LZMA compression.  -b255 selects maximum buffer
size of 255 MB for building a dynamic dictionary.  -m255 selects maximum memory.
-s turns off spaces modeling.  -f8 sets the minimum word frequency for dictionary
inclusion to 8 (default is 6).

<p><a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=176333>xml-wrt 3.0</a>
(Sept. 14, 2006)
includes a stripped-down version of PAQ8 (-l11 option) in addition to LZMA compression.

<p><a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=176333>xwrt 3.2</a>
(Oct. 29, 2007) is a dictionary preprocessor frontend to LZMA, PPMVC and lpaq6 as
well as a standalone preprocessor.  Option -l14 selects lpaq6 option 9 (1542 MB).
-b255 selects 255 MB memory (maximum) for building the dictionary.  -m96 selects
96 MB buffer during compression.  (Higher values cause out of memory error).
-s turns of space modeling.  -e40000 limits the dictionary size to 40000 words.
-f200 limits the dictionary to words that occur at least 200 times.

(XML Word Reducing Transform)
is a free command line single file preprocessor with source code
by Przemyslaw Skibinski, May 10, 2006.
It is not intended to compress files by itself (although it does somewhat).
Rather, it is intended to improve the compressibility of text and XML files by replacing
common words and XML substrings with shorter symbols.  (So it is actually LZW with a
static dictionary prepended to the output).  
It improves compression for most programs except for those
that already have English text models such as paq8h.  Some additional results
are shown below for combinations with some other compressors.

<p>The -f option (default -f6) selects the minimum word frequency required to have it
added to the dictionary.  The optimal setting depends on the input size.  When used
with ppmd or ppmonstr (the best compressors improved by XML-WRT), the optimal settings
are about -f180 for enwik8 and -f1800 for enwik9, which results in a dictionary of 7697
words for enwik8 and 6657 words for enwik9.
The following table shows the effect of the -f and -o options for ppmonstr -m800 enwik9.
The best combination found is -f1800 -o8.

<p><a href=http://www.ii.uni.wroc.pl/~inikep/research/XML/XML-WRT20.zip>xml-wrt 2.0</a>
released June 14, 2006 (updated June 19, 2006)
has additional transform options, and also includes LZ77 (zlib)
and LZMA (LZ with arithmetic coding) compression.  When used as a preprocessor,
this compression is turned off.  enwik9 was compressed using the options:

<pre>
  xml-wrt -l0 -w -s -c -b255 -m100 -e10000 enwik9
  ppmonstr e -o8 -m800 enwik9.xwrt
</pre>

<p>The option -l0 turns off compression. -w turns off word containers.  -s turns off
space modeling (this hurts compression in version 1.0 but helps in 2.0).  -c turns
off word and number containers (independent of -w and -n.  -n hurts compression).
-b255 sets memory for the dictionary to 255 MB, the maximum.  -m100 sets the
memory buffer to 100 MB, which is not maximum (255 MB), but larger values hurt
compression.  -e10000 sets the dictionary size to 10000 words.  (The dictionary
size can also be controlled with -f as in version 1.0, but using -e is less dependent
on input size so it helps with enwik8).  Additional tests showing the effects of -e, -m, and -o:

<p>The optimal values of -w -c -s -n (turn off number containers) and
-t (turn off try shorter words) was determined on enwik7 and enwik8
but not tested on enwik9.

<p>A bug fix for LZMA compression, released June 19, 2006, does not change any
values for the June 14, 2006 version (using the -l0 option).  
However the compressed source code increases from 25,290 bytes to 25,354 bytes.
The June 14 version is no longer published.  The URL is unchanged.

<h3>.1563 WinRK</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.msoftware.co.nz/>WinRK</a> 3.0.3 is a commercial
GUI archiver by Malcolm Taylor
(Mar. 6, 2006).  It is top ranked on some benchmarks.
Unfortunately it is not available for free download (as of May 16, 2006).  The
"free trial" expires as soon as you install it.
(Update, Sept. 11, 2006: versions 3.0.2 and 3.0.3 are no longer available for download.  
They appear to have been withdrawn last month).
WinRK in PWCM mode (Paq Weighted Context
Modeling) is based on the paq7/8 algorithm with text dictionary preprocessing
and specialized models for wav, bmp, and exe files.  Version 3.0.2 was based on
the earlier paq6 algorithm which uses adaptive linear model mixing rather than
a neural network which mixes bitwise predictions from models 
in the logistic (log p/(1-p)) domain.  The +td and -td options turns English dictionary
preprocessing on or off respectively.  800MB selects the memory limit.  When not
specified, PWCM appears to allocate all available memory except leaving 8 MB.

<h3>.1570 ppmonstr, ppmd, ppms</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.compression.ru/ds/>ppmonstr, ppmd, and ppms</a> var. J are
free command line file compressors by Dmitry Shkarin (model) and
Dmitry Subbotin (range coder), Feb. 16, 2006. (ppms on Feb. 21, 2006).
ppmonstr is a slower, experimental version of ppmd with better compression.
Source code is available for ppms and ppmd but not ppmonstr.
ppms is a small memory (1 MB) version of ppmd.
They all use PPMII (PPM with information inheritance).  The -m256
option selects 256 MB memory (maximum for ppmd).  The -o10 option selects
PPM order 10.  (Higher orders use up memory faster which hurts
compression).  When ppmd runs out of memory, it discards the
model and starts over.  The -r1 option (default in ppmonstr)
tells ppmd to back up and partially rebuild the model before resuming compression.
The default options for ppmd are -m10 -o4 -r0 which are designed for reasonably
good compression with high speed and low memory usage (see table below).

<p>ppms accepts only options -o2 through -o8. The default is -o5. This also gives
the best compression on enwik8. Task Manager shows 1.8 MB memory used.

<h3>.1598 slim</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.bars-trade.com/slim/>slim</a> 23d is a free, closed source command line
archiver by Serge Voskoboynikov, Sept 21, 2004.  It uses a PPMII core
(ppmd/ppmonstr) by Dmitry Shkarin with filters for special file types including text.
The -m700 option selects 700 MB of memory.  (I found -m800 causes
disk thrashing at 1 GB).  The -o10 option selects order 10 PPM.  (-o12 and -o16
caused slim to fail on enwik9, creating an empty archive and exiting after about 60% completion with 1 GB.  
Smaller files were OK.  There was no error with 2 GB).

<p>As with other PPM compressors (ppmd, ppmonstr), using a higher order improves
compression but consumes memory faster.  For enwik8, -o32 is optimal with 700MB available,
but lower orders are better for enwik9.

<h3>.1605 bwmonstr</h3>

<a href=http://www.nanozip.net/bwmonstr.html>bwmonstr</a> 0.00 is a free, experimental,
closed source
file compressor by Sami Runsas, Mar. 10, 2009. It uses BWT. The program takes no
options. It loads the input file into a single block and allocates 1.25 times the
block size in memory for either compression or decompression (like BBB).
Thus, it is able to transform enwik9 in a single block.

<p>bwmonstr 0.01 was released Mar. 18, 2009.

<p>bwmonstr 0.02 was released July 8, 2009. It uses a compressed representation internally,
thus memory usage is less than the 1 GB block size. It compresses the entire input file in
a single block and will fail if there is not enough memory. The program is multi-threaded
even on a single block. Times shown are for a single core processor, but would be faster on
a multi-core processor.

exists. Tested by the author on a quad core Q6600 at 3.0 GHz.
The older version is withdrawn.

<a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1432-Experimental-new-ZCM-file-compressor!>(discussion)</a>
is a free, experimental, closed source compressor for 32 bit Windows
by Nania Francesco Antonio,
Dec. 16, 2011. It uses context mixing. Commands c1 through c7 select memory
usage for compression. Decompression uses the same memory. c7 uses the most
memory and gets the best compression.

<p>zcm v0.02 was released Dec. 23, 2011.

<p>zcm v0.03 was released Dec. 28, 2011.

<p>zcm v0.04 was released Jan. 30, 2012. (Program banner says v0.03).

<p><a href=http://heartofcomp.altervista.org/zcmo.zip>zcm v0.11</a>
was released Feb. 19, 2012.
It is described as mixing 6 contexts. It detect file type and uses exe, delta,
and LZP preprocessors. It has separate models for text and binary data.
Speed and memory usage are the same for compression and
decompression. Commands c0 through c7 select memory usage. Each increment
doubles memory, resulting in better compression.
Memory is used slowly as the program runs up to a maximum value which is not reached on
enwik8 for c5 and higher. For enwik8, c7 uses 1286 MB rather than 1716 MB.

<p><a href=http://heartofcomp.altervista.org/zcm20.zip>zcm 0.20b</a> was released
Apr. 4, 2012. It is an archiver rather than a single file compressor.
Option -m7 selects maximum memory usage (range 32 MB to 1.7 GB).

<p>zcm 0.30 was released May 2, 2012.

<p>zcm 0.40 was released May 16, 2012. It is described as using CM with
6 contexts, a mixer, and one re-mixer (APM or SSE) to adjust the mixer
output. It uses LZP preprocessing.

<p><a href=http://heartofcomp.altervista.org/ZCM/home.htm>zcm 0.50a</a>
was released June 2, 2012.

<p><a href=http://heartofcomp.altervista.org/zcm060.zip>zcm 0.60d</a>
adds multithreading and other improvements. The -t option selects the
number of tasks. -t0 auto-detects the number of cores, which is equivalent
to -t2 on the dual core test machine (T3200, 3 GB). The default is -t1.
The -m option selects memory usage from -m1 (46 MB per task)
to -m7 (1.6 GB per task). The default is -m4. Parallel compression is
performed by separate processes that can independently access 2 GB of memory
each in 32 bit Windows. When run with -t2, there is also a third task using
5 MB of memory. All three tasks saturate one CPU core each.
It was found that -t2 makes compression worse (probably by splitting the
input in half and compressing each separately) and is not much faster than
-t1. The -t option can also be given during extraction. If the archive
was compressed with -t2 then extraction with -t2 doubles memory usage
but only improves speed slightly. If compressed with -t1 then extraction
with -t2 is 4 seconds slower for enwik8 than with -t1 because the extra task exits
immediately and the third 5 MB task continues to run.

<h3>.1637 M03</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.michael-maniscalco.com/compression.htm>M99</a>
(<a href=m99.zip>mirror</a>) is a free
file compressor by Michael Maniscalco, originally written in 1999 and ported
to Windows on Mar. 27, 2007.  It uses BWT, based on MSufSort 3.1.
M99 is a predecessor to M03.  Command line is:
<pre>
M99.exe e|d -switches blocksize input output 

switches are:
-r = post BWT run length encoding
-a = arithmetic coding instead of M99 style bit packing
-f = fast mode
-m = max compression mode (implies -a).
</pre>
Blocksize can be specified in bytes (like 10000), kb, mb etc as 100m or 100k.
Memory requirement for compression is 6 times the blocksize maximum, although in most cases only
a little over 5 times blocksize is used.  Blocksize 239m divides enwik9 into 4 approximately
equal parts and requires about 1500 MB memory.

<p>Version 2.1 was released Apr. 19, 2007.

<p><a href=http://www.michael-maniscalco.com/downloads/m99.v2.2.zip>M99 2.2.1</a>,
released July 18, 2008,
has an optimization to compress the contents of TAR files separately. For other files,
it increases the size by 1 byte.

<p><a href=http://www.michael-maniscalco.com/downloads/M03.0.2a.zip>M03 v0.2a</a>,
Oct. 10, 2009,
takes just one option, which is the block size in bytes. Memory usage is 6x
block size for compression and 5x for decompression.

<p><a href=http://michael-maniscalco.com/downloads/M03.64.rar>M03 v1.1 beta</a>
was released Oct. 24, 2011 for 64 bit Windows.
It includes some new, fully parallel
suffix sorting and BWT construction algorithms. The option 1000000000
specifies a single block requiring 5 GB memory to compress or decompress.

<a href=http://encode.dreamhosters.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1249&d=1270631025>x64</a>
is a free, experimental file compressor by Ilya Grebnov, Apr. 7, 2010. It uses BWT with LZP
preprocessing. The option -b1000t selects a block size of 1000 MB and turns off multithreading
(parallel compression on multiple cores). Memory requirements is 6x block size times number of
threads. Multithreading was turned off (-t) for both compression and decompression in order
to maximize compression. Nevertheless, compression shows CPU utilization of 109% on 2 cores
even with -t set. -p turns off LZP preprocessing. -m2 selects a sort (Schindler) transform
of order 5.

<p>Other options select LZP table size (default 2<sup>18</sup> bytes, range 10..28), LZP
match length (default 128, range 4..255), block sorting algorithm (default BWT, possible
order 4 or 5 sort (Schindler) transform), and preceding or following context for sorting
(default following). Only the defaults were tested, which may not be optimal. There
are two versions: x86 for 32 bit Windows with a 2 GB memory limit, and x64 for 64 bit
Windows with no memory limit. Notes apply to enwik9. enwik8 size is tested as in note 26.

<a href=http://encode.dreamhosters.com/showthread.php?p=11701#post11701>(discussion)</a>,
Apr. 11, 2010,
are bug fixes that do not change results except for the size of the program.
The x64 version is 276,292 bytes.

<p><a href=http://libbsc.com/default.aspx>bsc</a> 2.00, May 3, 2010,
is available with source code licensed under LGPL.

<p>bsc 2.20, June 15, 2010, has speed improvements for multi-core support.
-b1000p means use 1000 MB
block size (-b1000, requires 5 GB memory) with no preprocessing (-p).
-b80p uses 80 MB block size with no preprocessing. -m2f means use
sort transform order 5 (-m2) and fast compression (-f).
enwik8 was tested as in note 26 on bsc-x32 replacing -b1000p with -b100p.

<p>bsc 2.26, July 26, 2010, has some speed improvements but retains compatibility
with version 2.25. -b328 selects a block size of 328 MB, which divides enwik9
into 3 blocks. This is the fewest number of blocks supported by the x86 version
because of a 2 GB process limit. The x64 version does not have this limit but
requires 64 bit Windows. -t disables parallel block processing, which would double the
memory requirement. -T disables all multicore processing. This gives a smaller compressed
size but is slower than -t. -T or -t must be specified during decompression
to prevent an out of memory error. With -t, CPU usage is 156% for compression and 129%
for decompression on a dual core T3200 (2 GHz, 3 GB, Vista 32 bit).

<p>bsc 2.4.5, Jan. 3, 2011, improves the speed of decompression. It remains
compatible with the previous version.

<p>bsc 2.5.0, Mar. 20, 2011, had no significant changes for the tests performed.
Minor performance enhancements. CRC32 is replaced with Adler32.

<p>bsc 3.0.0, Aug. 27, 2011 adds experimental NVIDEA (CUDA) GPU acceleration for
forward sort transforms ST5 through ST8. ST7 and ST8 are GPU only. There are
32 and 64 bit versions. For the test shown, the 64 bit version was used.
-b32 means to select 32 MB block
size, -p disables preprocessing, -m8 selects order 8 sort transform, and
-f selects fast compression. The test machine is a Core-i7 2600K (4 cores,
8 threads, 8 MB cache) overclocked from 3.4 GHz
to 4.6 GHz, with a 384 CUDA processor GeForce 560Ti GPU, overclocked from 822
MHz to 900 MHZ, with 2000 MHz memory speed.
Compression takes 8.705 seconds using 1129 MB CPU memory
and about 1 GB GPU memory. Decompression uses only the CPU, taking 18.595 seconds
using 1395 MB memory.

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/threads/586-bsc-new-block-sorting-compressor?p=29904&viewfull=1#post29904>bsc 3.1.0</a>,
July 9, 2012, is a test version, not compatible with v3.0.0. Source was not released.

<h3>.1640 bbb</h3>

<a href=bbb.cpp>bbb</a> ver. 1
is a free, open source (GPL) command line file compressor by Matt Mahoney, Aug. 31, 2006.
It uses a memory efficient BWT allowing blocks up to 80% of available memory.
The transformed data is compressed with an order 0 PAQ like model: the previous
bits of the current byte are mapped first to a bit history, then through a 6 level
probability correcting adaptive chain before bitwise arithmetic coding.

<p>The m1000 command selects 1000 MB block size.  Thus, enwik9 is suffix sorted in one block.
This is accomplished by sorting 16 smaller blocks, writing the pointers to 4 GB
of temporary files, and merging them.  The inverse transform is done in memory without
building a linked list.  Rather, the next position is found by looking up the
approximate location in an index of size n/16 and finding the exact location by
linear search.

<p><a href=bbb.exe>bbb.exe</a> Win32 executable
compiled with MinGW g++ 3.4.2 and UPX 1.24w.
<pre>
  g++ -Wall -O2 -Os -march=pentiumpro -fomit-frame-pointer -s -o bbb.exe
  upx bbb.exe
</pre>

<p><a href=bbb>bbb</a> Linux executable, supplied by
Phil Carmody (Aug. 31, 2006).  Compiled with <tt>g++-4.1 -Wall -O2 -o bbb bbb.cpp; strip bbb</tt>

<p>bbb has a faster mode for both compression and decompression that does a "normal"
BWT using 5x blocksize in memory.  Output format is the same for fast and slow mode
for both compression and decompression.  A file compressed in fast mode can be
decompressed in slow mode on another computer with less memory, and vice versa.
The mode has no effect on the compressed file contents.

<p>Recommended usage for best compression:  For files smaller than 20% of available
memory, use fast mode and one block.  For example, if you have 1 GB memory (800 MB
available under Windows) and <tt>foo</tt> is 100 MB:
<pre>
  bbb cfm100 foo foo.bbb  (c = compress, f = fast, m100 = 100 MB blocks)
  bbb df foo.bbb foo.out  (d = decompress, f = fast)
</pre>
If the file is 20% to 80% of available memory, use one block in slow mode.  If <tt>foo</tt>
is 500 MB:
<pre>
  bbb cm500 foo foo.bbb
  bbb d foo.bbb foo.out
</pre>
If the file is over 80% of memory, use 80% of memory as the block size in slow mode.
If <tt>foo</tt> is 1 GB:
<pre>
  bbb cm640 foo foo.bbb
  bbb d foo.bbb foo.out
</pre>
The model requires about an additional 6 MB that should be subtracted 
from available memory.

<p>bbb results by block size are shown below.
Gain is the compression improvement obtained by using a larger block size.
Gain(blocksize) is defined as C(blocksize/10)/C(blocksize) - 1 where
C(x) means the compressed size of enwik9 with block size x.
Compression times are fast modes for block sizes 10 through 10<sup>8</sup>
and slow mode for 10<sup>9</sup> on a 2.2 GHz Athlon-64 with 2 GB memory under WinXP Home SP2.

<h3>.1652 paq9a</h3>

<a href=paq9a.zip>paq9a</a> is a free,
open source, command line archiver by Matt Mahoney, Dec. 31, 2007.
It is a context mixing compressor with an LZP preprocessor to improve speed
for highly redundant files.  Matches to a context length of 12 or more are
coded as 1 bit, and literals as 9 bits.  Context mixing differs from paq8 in
that it uses a chain of 2-input mixers rather than one mixer with many inputs.
It mixes sparse order-1 contexts with gaps of 3, 2, 1, 0, then orders 2 through 6,
then text word orders 0 and 1.  Option -9 selects maximum memory.

is a parameter file for M1 0.3b obtained by mhajicek after about 3 days of CPU time
running M1's genetic optimization program on enwik8.

<p><a href=http://freenet-homepage.de/toffer_86/m1x2_0.5_091208.7z>M1x2 v0.5-1</a>
was released Dec. 8, 2009. The option 6 means to use 48 x 2<sup>6</sup> MB memory.
The option enwik7.txt is an optimization file which resulted from tuning parameters
on the first 10 MB of the benchmark by a separate optimization process. It must be
specified during decompression. The file size (242 bytes) is included in the
decompresser size. The program includes source code and compiled Windows and Linux
versions. The Windows version was tested. The program is described as follows
by the author:

<p><blockquote>
M1x2 mixes two ordinary M1 models in the logistic domain (thus four models in
total). Data is processed bitwise with a flat decomposition. Contexts are
mapped to states, which represent bit histories encountered under the
corresponding context. In this implementation contexts are restricted to byte
masks with some tweaks for text; the context mapping is implemented using hash
tables. Two bit history states s1, s2 are quantised
Q(.,.) and mapped to a linear counter to produce a prediction p = P(y=1|Q(s1,
s2)), where y is the next bit. Afterwards two predictions are transformed into
the logistic domain and mixed linearily. The final prediction is: p = Sq[
(St(p2)-St(p1))*w + St(p1) ]; St(.) and Sq(.) name stretch and squash (see PAQ)
There is just a single weight w in [0, 1]. The Predictions and the weight are
updated to minimize coding
cost. As in previous versions a genetic optimzier can tune all degrees of
freedom
to a training data set. Parameters include: contexts, state machine structure,
counter and mixer settings.

<a href=http://encode.dreamhosters.com/showthread.php?p=11055#post11055>(discussion)</a>,
Feb. 8, 2010,
preprocesses the input by pre-compressing it with an order-1 12 bit length limited
Huffman code prior to compression with the context mixing model of v0.5-1.
This improves speed by reducing the size of the input and improves compression
because the context hash tables are not filled as quickly.
The 7 option says to use 8 x 2<sup>7</sup> MB memory. The decompresser size includes
the 242 byte configuration file enwik7.txt.
The length limited Huffman codes are generated using an algorithm described by
A. Turpin and A. Moffat in

<p><a href=http://freenet-homepage.de/toffer_86/cmm4_01e_080420.7z>cmm4 v0.1e</a>
was released Apr. 20, 2008 without source code.  It takes a 2 digit option "wm"
(e.g. 96 meaning w=9, m=6).  Memory usage is 2<sup>w</sup> MB for a sliding
window, and 12*2<sup>m</sup> MB for a context mixing model
(order 1,2,3,4,6).  On my machine m=7 caused disk thrashing.

<p>Description by the author:
CMM4 0.1e Is a variable order context mixing coder, it predicts using 
the four "highest" (ranking: 643210) models in each bit coding step and, 
in addition, the match model input. Orders 0 and 1 are implemented using 
a table lookup, all higher orders use nibble based hashing. Matches are 
found using order 4 and 6 LZP, the pointers and a quick exclusion hash 
are stored within the model's hashing tables. The mixer joins the 4 (or 
5 in presence of a match model) predictions and outputs them to a SSE 
stage. A mixer (similar to (L)PAQ) is selected based on the last byte's 
4 MSBs and on the coding order. The SSE context is made of an order 0 
context and qunatized combination of the previous symbol rank, the match 
length and partially matched symbol. This results in a notable 
compression increase on redundant data. The model's counters are 
quantized using the PAQ's state machine since CMM4 (will be replaced).
Despite the use of hashing most data structures are tuned to never cross 
a cache line per nibble (the models) or octet (the mixer) (only SSE 
does). The core compression performance is equivalent to LPAQ1/2, while 
being faster. In addition there's a filter framework, which currently 
implements an x86 transform and will be extended.

<h3>.1744 bit</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.osmanturan.com/bit.zip>bit 0.1</a>is a free, closed
source file compressor by Osman Turan, Dec. 19, 2007.  It uses ROLZ optimized
for binary files.  It takes no options.

<p><a href=http://www.osmanturan.com/bit02.zip>bit 0.2b</a> is an archiver,
released June 14, 2008.
Option -m lwcm selects the compression type (lightweight context mixint).
This is the only type supported. Option -mem 9 selects maximum memory.
This option ranges from 0 to 9 and uses 3 + 2<sup>opt</sup> MB memory.
The program uses order 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 context mixing with 2 SSE stages
as discussed <a href=http://www.encode.ru/forum/showthread.php?p=1052#post1052>here</a>.
Comments by author:
<blockquote>
<p>LWCX (Light-Weight Context Mixing) is a codec of BIT Archiver.
It's designed for getting high compression ratio with acceptable speed
(Not enough fast currently). LWCX is a bit-wise context mixing schema which
tries to mix order-n models (order 012346). The statistics are gathered by
the counters which predict next bit by semi-stationary update rule. After
gathering the predictions from all models, a neural network (similar to PAQ's
neural network) tries to output a new mixed prediction. The mixed prediction
is processed by a 2D SSE stage which have 32 vertices. Finally, a carryless
arithmetic coder codes the given bit with final prediction.

<p>Most of data structures are designed for avoiding cache misses. Order-0
and order-1 models' statistics stored in a direct lookup table. Higher orders
(order 2346) models' statistics stored in a large hash table. Hash table size
can be selected by "-mem N" option (memory usage is 3+2^(N+1) MB, N ranges
0 to 9). The codec locates a hash entry per only coding nibble.
</blockquote>

<p><a href=http://www.osmanturan.com/bit07.zip>bit 0.7</a> has options
-p=1 through -p=5 to select memory usage of 10 + 20*2<sup>p</sup> MB.

<p>-mb produces bzip2 compatible format. -M has no effect. Memory usage is fixed at 4 MB.

<p>-mc uses DMC. If memory is greater than -M512, then the program aborts with an assertion failed.

<p>-md and -md64 are supposed to generate deflate and deflate64 formats (zip or gzip). However
-mdf and -md64f (fast modes) crash immediately during compression. The other modes decompress to
files that are the correct size but not identical to the original. Run times are very slow due
to most of the CPU time spent in the kernel (up to 90%) as reported by timer 3.01.

<p>-mp used PPMD var. J, but allows more memory (up to about 1800 MB). The original program
was limited to 256 MB. The optimal orders are different for enwik8 and enwik9.
Higher orders help compression, but lower orders save memory on larger files. The
maximum order is -o16. Higher values have no effect.
Decompression is slow due to 55% of the CPU time spent in the kernel. Normally this
is around 1% and decompression speed would be the same as compression.

<p>-msl and -msm ignore the -M option and use 1 MB memory, resulting in poor compression.

<p>-mw (experimental BWT) is the only option that uses both cores. All others result
in 50% CPU usage on a 2 core processor. The -M option actually
selects the block size, not total memory usage. Memory usage is 5x block size if one core is used,
or 10x if both are used. Both are used only if enough memory is available. The default is to
split the file in half and compress the two halves in parallel. However, better but slower compression
can be obtained by using -M to select one block for the whole file. Maximum memory is 2 GB, even
if more is available. For enwik9, -M320 selects 3 blocks, which are compressed in series on one core.
For two cores, time reported is wall time.
Process time for -mw -M320m is 187% of wall time for compression and 139% for decompression.

<h3>.1749 epmopt | epm</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.compression.ru/so/>epmopt + epm</a> r9 is an experimental,
closed source
command line optimizer and file compressor by Serge Osnach, Oct. 16, 2003.  It was
intended for enc r16, but development on that project has stopped at enc r15, according
to the web page (in Russian).  The program has two parts: epm, a
PPM compressor with text preprocessing, and epmopt, which attempts to optimize
the parameters to epm by compressing repeatedly and varying the options one at a
time until there is no more improvement.  The input to epmopt may be different
than epm, and supports optimization on sets of files matching patterns in
specified sets of directories.  The options to epm are memory limit, PPM order,
and 20 undocumented options each specified by a single digit.  The exact same options
must be passed to the decompresser.  In the results, I added 27 bytes to the
compressed file sizes to account for this information.  enwik9 was compressed
and decompressed as follows:
<pre>
  epmopt -m800 -n20 --fixedorder:12 enwik6 .
  epm c01286014321245957352513 enwik9 enwik9.epm -m800
  epm d01286014321245957352513 enwik9.epm enwik9.tmp -m800
</pre>
The optimization data was enwik6, the first 10<sup>6</sup> bytes
of the input file.  epmopt compressed this about 100 times in
368 seconds with different options, making 35 passes through
the list of 20 undocumented parameters, adjusting each one up
or down one at a time.  The fixed parameters
were -m800 (800 MB memory limit) and PPM order 12 (--fixedorder:12,
also the first 3 digits of the parameter string.  Allowing epmopt
to set the PPM order on a smaller training file will cause it to
choose too large a value, hurting compression.  I only tested
orders 10, 12, and 20 on enwik8 and 12 gave the best compression).
The -n20 option tells epm to tune all 20 parameters.  The parameter
string is written to the file enc.ini.  The -m800 option need
not be the same for epmopt and epm but must be the same
for epm during compression and decompression.

<p>Warning: epm failed to decompress correctly on enwik7 (first
10<sup>7</sup> bytes).  In the output, some linefeeds were changed
to spaces.  This happened with all parameter combinations I
tested including defaults: <tt>epm c enwik7 enwik7.epm</tt>.
Decompression was bit-exact for enwik5, enwik6, enwik8 and enwik9.

archiver by Malyshev Dmitry Alexandrovich, Jan. 2, 2007.  It uses BWT + distance coding without preprocessors.
The -b333m option selects 333 MB
blocks. -f (-f0 in 0.40 and 0.46, not supported in 0.32) forces no segmentation. 
Memory usage is 5 times the block size for compression
(6x prior to v0.46).

<h3>.1760 FreeArc</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.haskell.org/bz/>FreeArc</a> 0.36 is a free, open source archiver
by Bulat Ziganshin, Feb. 21, 2007.  It incorporates 7 compression libraries - PPMd, 
GRZipII, LZMA (7zip), plus BCJ (7zip), REP (rzip-like), dynamic dictionary and LZP 
preprocessors. The option -m9 selects maximum compression (dict + LZP + PPMd for text 
files, REP+LZMA for binary).  -lc1600000000 limits
memory to 1.6 GB (same as -lc1600m).  There is an option to use ppmonstr as an external
compressor, which was not included in the test.

<p><a href=http://www.haskell.org/bz/>FreeArc</a> 4.0 pre-4</a> is a free, open source
archiver by Bulat Ziganshin, Dec. 16, 2007.  It compresses using ppmd, GRZipII, and LZMA
along with multimedia filters, a dictionary preprocessor and a REP preprocessor
for removing repeating strings.  It has Windows and Linux versions and an optional GUI.

<p>ppmd generally gives the best compression for text.  It will also call ppmonstr
as an external program, but this mode was not tested, even though it compresses better.

<p>For this test, the Windows command line version was tested.  The option 
-mppmd:1012m:o13:r1 is equivalent to ppmd -m1012 -o13 -r1, selecting 1012 MB memory,
order 13, and partial reinitialization of the model when memory is exhausted.
Note that ppmd normally allows only up to -m256.  This program was tested with 2 GB
memory but values higher than -m1012 caused the program to crash during compression.

<h3>.1766 hook</h3>

<a href=hook.zip>hook</a> v0.2 is a free, 
open source (GPL) command line file
compressor by Nania Francesco Antonio, Jan. 8, 2007.  It uses DMC: a state machine
in which each state represents a bitwise context.  Each state has 2 outgoing
transitions corresponding to next bits 0 and 1, and a count n0 or n1 associated
with each transition.  Bit y (0 or 1) is compressed by arithmetic coding with probability
ny/(n0+n1) (where ny is n0 or n1 according to y), and then ny is incremented.

<p>After each input bit, the next state represents a context obtained by appending that
bit on the right and possibly dropping bits on the left.
States are cloned (copied) whenever the incoming and outgoing counts exceed certain limits.
This has the effect of creating a new context in which no bits are dropped.
In the example below, the state representing context 110 (dropping 2 bits from the
previous context) is cloned by creating a new state 11110 because the incoming 0 
transition count (ny for y=0) from state 1111 exceeded a limit.  The new context is 
longer because it does not drop any bits.  This transition is moved to point to the 
new state.  Other incoming transitions (not shown) remain pointing to the
original state.  The outgoing transitions are copied.  The counts of the original
state are distributed to the new state in proportion to the moved transition's
contribution to those counts, which is w = ny/(n0+n1).
<pre>
                n0 ----> 1100           n0*(1-w) ----> 1100

        Before cloning            After cloning 110 to 11110
</pre>

<p>Normally, the initial set of contexts begin on byte boundaries.  The cloning
mechanism ensures that new contexts also have this property.

<p>In hook v0.2, the counts are 32 bit floating point numbers initialized to 0.1.  The initial
state machine has 256*255 states representing bytewise order 1 contexts with uniform
statistics.  When memory is exhausted, the model is discarded and the state machine
is reinitialized.
A new state is cloned when ny > limit and n0+n1-ny > length, where limit and length
are parameters.  The optimal parameters for enwik8 and enwik9 are "c 7 2 6", 
c means compress, 7 selects
the maximum of 1 GB memory (64M states at 16 bytes each, minimum is 8 MB memory), 
2 is the limit (range 1 to 7), 
and 6 selects a length of 32 (possible values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64).
Larger lengths are better for large files because they
conserve memory at the expense of compression.

<p>hook v0.3 (Jan. 11, 2007) allows up to 1.8 GB memory (first option = 9)
and uses double precision predictions in the 32 bit arithmetic coder.

<p>hook v0.3a (Jan. 12, 2007) initializes the counts to 0.125 (instead of 0.1) and uses 24 bit
precision in the arithmetic coder (instead of 32 bit).

<p>hook v0.4 (Jan. 15, 2007) initializes counts to 0.1.  Argument 2 selects length 3 (not 2).

<p>hook v0.5b (Jan. 22, 2007) adds an LZP preprocessor.  If the next byte to be coded is the
same as the byte that occurred in the last matching 3 byte context, then this is indicated
by coding a flag bit in an order 3 model (32 MB memory), and a match length coded by DMC
with a fixed size of 128 MB.  If there is no match, then the literal byte is coded by 
another variable sized DMC model.  The parameters "c 1600000000 2 64 1 6" select compression
(c), 1.6 GB for the DMC literal model (1600000000), a limit of 2 (minimum count for the cloned
state), length of 64 (minimum remaining count for the state to be cloned), LZP selected (1),
and a minimum match length of 6.

<p>hook v0.6 (Feb. 7, 2007) removes the "length" parameter (effectively infinite).  The
arguments "c 1600 4 1 6" mean to compress (c), use 1600 MB memory, set the "limit" parameter
to 4, turn on LZP preprocessing (1) with a minimum match length of 6.  The "limit" parameter
is the minimum count for an outbound DMC state transition to clone the state.  Limit was
tuned on enwik8.

<p>hook v0.6b (Feb. 8, 2007) includes support for files up to 2<sup>64</sup> bytes (compiled
by Ilia Muraviev.  Earlier versions were compiled with MinGW g++ 3.4.5 by Matt Mahoney.)
"limit" was tuned on both enwik8 and enwik9.  Higher values
conserve memory at the expense of compression on smaller files.

<p>hook v0.6c (Feb. 14, 2007) stores the input filename in the compressed file and uses
it during decompression.

<p>hook v0.7 (Mar. 10, 2007) uses 325 MB more memory than advertised so it was tested with
a lower option.

<p>hook v0.7b (Mar. 12, 2007) reduces the excess memory to 94 MB.

<p>hook v0.8 was released Mar. 17, 2007.  Some additional results on enwik9
decreasing the rate at which the state machine fills up and is flushed:

<p>hook v0.8b (Mar. 18, 2007) has some LZP improvements.

<p>hook v0.8c (Mar. 19, 2007) is a minor bug fix.  Compressed sizes are 1 byte
larger than v0.8b.

<p>hook v0.8d was released Mar. 21, 2007.

<p>hook v0.8e was released Mar. 27, 2007.

<p>hook v0.9 (Apr. 6, 2007) is closed source.  It requires a processor that
supports SSE instructions.  It has some speed improvements and
a E8/E9 filter for improved compression of .exe files.  Memory usage is
the second argument + 60MB.

<p><a href=http://eugene.ath.cx/projects/freehook-0.2.zip>freehook 0.2</a>
is an open source port of hook v0.8e from C++ to C by Eugene Ortmann, Apr. 7, 2007.
The supplied .exe file requires SSE instructions (Pentium 3 or higher),
but the source can be recompiled for other processors.

<p>hook v0.9b (Apr 10, 2007) replaces floating point arithmetic with integer
arithmetic, so that archives are compatible across different processors.
Note: I reduced the memory setting from 1800 to 1700 to prevent disk thrashing,
which was a problem in earlier tests.  I will do this from now on.
This hurts enwik9 compression (but not enwik8) slightly, from 180,444,546 
to 180,582,601.  Actual memory usage is 60 MB over.

<p><a href=http://eugene.ath.cx/projects/freehook-0.3.zip>freehook 0.3</a>
(Apr 10, 2007) has only very minor changes from 0.2 but is
slightly faster due to different g++ compiler options.  Compression is the
same as 0.2.  Memory usage is about 160 MB over.

<p>hook v0.9c (May 8, 2007) has some speed improvements in the arithmetic
coder.  It compresses the same size as v0.9b.

<p>hook v1.0 (Sept. 20, 2007) is closed source.  The only option is
memory size in MB.

<p>The zip file linked above contains all versions (C++ source and Win32 .exe).

<p>hook 1.1 (Nov. 13, 2007)

<p>hook 1.3 was
released Dec. 14, 2007, modified Dec. 15, 2007.

<p><a href=http://heartofcomp.altervista.org/>hook 1.4</a> was

<h3>.1789 7zip</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.7-zip.org/>7zip</a> 4.42 is an open source GUI and command line archiver
by Igor Pavlov, May 14, 2006.  It compresses to 7z, zip, gzip, ppmd.H and tar format,
optionally encrypts with AES, and will uncompress several other formats.

<p>7z is the default format.  It uses LZMA compression, a variation of LZ77.
The option -mx=9 selects ultra (maximum) compression in this mode.  The option
-sfx7zCon.sfx creates a console-based self extracting executable by prepending
a 131,584 byte decompresser.  This is slightly smaller than the Windows GUI version
(132,096 bytes) and much smaller than the decompression program itself as a zipped
self extracting download (817,795 bytes).  The best compression is with ppmd.
The options are -m0=ppmd:mem=768m:o=10 equivalent to ppmd var H (with minor changes)
order 10 with 768 MB memory.

<a href=http://www.7-zip.org/alpha/7z446a1.msi>7zip 4.46a</a> was announced May 21, 2007.
(The improved compression is due to testing with more memory).

<p>7zip 9.04a was released Dec. 3, 2009. It gave an out of memory error
with mem=1630.

<p>7zip 9.20 was released Nov. 18, 2010. Default (LZMA) mode was tested. It uses
196 MB for compression using 75% of 2 cores, and 18 MB for decompression
on a 2.0 GHz T3200 under Windows.

<p>The following include the best known option combinations for 7zip on enwik8
in ppmd (PPM), 7z (LZMA), bzip2 (BWT) and zip (LZ77) formats.

<h3>.1807 ash</h3>

<p><a href=http://compression.ru/sh/ash04a.rar>ash 04a</a>
is a free, experimental command line file compressor by
Eugene D. Shelwien, Dec. 5, 2003.  The /m700 option
selects 700 MB memory limit.  (/m800 causes disk thrashing with 1 GB).
/o10 selects model order 9.
This gives good results on smaller files when memory
is constrained, but I did not try to optimize it.
There is a /s option to select SSE depth that
gives good results for the default value of /s5
so I did not try to optimize it either.  Other results:

/m700 /o10 (order 9)  180,735,542  6011
</pre>
Note: the acutal memory usage (commit charge) for enwik9 /m700 /o8
was 1910 MB at the end of compression, minus 257 MB for
other programs, according to Windows task manager.  
This is generally not a problem if your
swap file is large enough.  It appears to be a slow memory
leak (recovered when program exits) and does not cause thrashing.

<p>ash /m1700 /o10 and /o12 failed to compress enwik9 with 2 GB memory
(error: could not allocate a block).
enwik8 compressed to 19,713,239 using /o10 and
19,446,859 using /o12.

<h3>.1823 ocamyd</h3>

<a href=http://www.geocities.ws/ocamyd/>ocamyd</a> 1.65.final is a free,
open source command line file compressor by Frank Schwellinger, May 25, 2006.
It uses DMC.  The -s0 selects slowest (maximum) compression.  The -m8 option
selects 800 MB memory (maximum is -m9 = 900 MB).

<p>ocamyd LTCB 1.0 is a modification by Mauro Vezzosi on June 20, 2006
of Frank Schwellinger's ocamyd-1.65-final.  The option -s0 selects
maximum compression.  -m3 selects 300 MB memory (the maximum for
the test machine), but it supports up to -m8.

<p>ocamyd 1.66.final, by Frank Schwellinger, Feb. 1, 2007, 
includes the -f option to prevent flushing and rebuilding
the DMC model when memory is exhausted.

<h3>.1824 bee</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.compression.ru/fa/>bee</a> 0.78 build 0154
is an open source (Delphi Object Pascal)
command line archiver (with optional GUI)
by Andrew Filinsky and Melchiorre Caruso, Sept. 23, 2005.
It uses PPM.  The -m3 option select maximum compression (default
is -m1).  The -d8 option selects 512 MB memory, the maximum that does
not cause disk thrashing (default is -d2 = 10 MB).

<p>bee includes beeopt, a parameter optimizer similar to epmopt.
This was not tested.  bee comes preconfigured with parameters
trained on .txt and .xml files (and other types) in file bee.ini.  This was tested by renaming
enwik7 (first 10<sup>7</sup> bytes)
to enwik7.txt and enwik7.xml but compression was worse.  
The executable size is a zip archive containing
bee.exe and bee.ini.  This is much smaller than the zipped source code download.

<h3>.1826 st</h3>

<p><a href=http://stcompression.com/>st</a> 0.51 is a free, closed source

3 compression levels, -n (normal), -f (fast) and -b (best). The memory
used depends on the file size and is higher for decompression (Dmem) than
compression (Cmem).

<h3>.1829 uhbc</h3>

<a href=ftp://ftp.elf.stuba.sk/pub/pc/pack/uhbc10.zip>uhbc 1.0</a> is
an experimental, closed source command line file compressor
by Uwe Herklotz, June 30, 2003.  It uses BWT.  The -b100m option
selects 100 MB block size, which requires 800 MB for compression
and 500 MB for decompression.  -m3 selects maximum compression
for the entropy coding stage, which consists of run length coding
(RLE) + DWFC (double weighted frequency counting) + entropy coding.
WFC is described in

<p>5.0 Dev 1 uses LZP.  
Dev 4 includes an improved hash table to conserve memory and a faster range coder compared to dev. 2,
but compression is the same. 
Starting with 5.0 dev 6, LZP literals
and match lengths are encoded using PPMC (PPM with fixed escape probabilities to lower orders).
Dev 7 and 9 use order 3-1-0 PPMC.

<h3>.1857 bwtsdc</h3>

<p><a href=http://bijective.dogma.net/bwtsdcV1.7z>bwtsdc v1</a>
(<a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1179-BIJECTIVE-BWTS-DC-FIB>discussion</a>)
is a free, experimental file compressor with source code
by David A. Scott and Yuta Mori. It takes no options. Memory usage is
5 times the file size.

The program
is bijective, meaning that any file is valid input to the decompresser,
and no two inputs will decompress to the same file. In other words, there is
an exact 1 to 1 mapping between uncompressed files and compressed files.

The compressor uses multiple
stages, each of which is bijective. The first stage is a BWT variant called
<a href=dce.html#Section_559>BWTS</a>
(BWT Scottified) developed by Scott. In this variation, it is not necessary
to store the starting point for the inverse BWT. This is achieved by dividing
the input into a lexicographically nonincreasing sequence of Lyndon words.
A Lyndon word is any subsequence that lexicographically precedes
any of its rotations. The block is then sorted using contexts that wrap
within Lyndon words rather than the whole block.
The BWTS is followed by distance coding (DC, developed in part by Mori),
and Fibonacci coding, where each stage is also bijective.
The compressor is implemented as 3 programs called from a .bat file.

<h3>.1859 fbc</h3>

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1502-FBC-Compressor>fbc</a> v1.0 is
a free, experimental file compressor for Windows by David Catt, Feb. 29, 2012.
It is described as using BWT (divsufsort) with a fast adapting (rate 1/16)
14 bit context model consisting of an 11 bit history and 3 bits
to encode the position in the current byte. The input is preprocessed using
Eugene Shelwein's alphabet reordering preprocessor, BWT_reorder_v2.
The argument 250000000
selects the block size in bytes. Memory usage if 5 x block size.

<p>fbc v1.1, Mar. 2, 2012,
fixes a memory allocation bug that caused decompression to fail
for a block size of 333 MB. It automatically selects between 32 and 64 bit
versions of divsufsort. Results are shown for the 64 bit version.

<h3>.1862 ppmvc</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.ii.uni.wroc.pl/~inikep/research/PPMVC/PPMVC11.zip>ppmvc v1.1</a>
is a free, command line file compressor by Przemysław Skibiński, May 12, 2006,
based on PPMd var. J by Dmitry Shkarin.  It uses variable length contexts
as described in the paper,
P. Skibinski and Sz. Grabowski.
<a href=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.97.5623&rep=rep1&type=pdf>
Variable-length contexts for PPM</a>.
Proceedings of the IEEE Data Compression Conference (DCC04), pp. 409-418, 2004.
Long matching strings are encoded as in high order ROLZ,
encoded as an index to a matching context and a length.

<p>The command line options are the same as in PPMd: -o8 selects order 8, -m256 selects
256 MB memory, -r1 partially rebuilds the model when memory is exhausted.  I tuned
the compressor to -o8 on enwik8.  There are additional options related to VC
compression (which must be specified during decompression), but I used the
defaults since there is no guidance on how to set them in the program documentation.
The paper suggests that the best values (and defaults) are to encode matches
of context length order+1 with a minimum match length of 2*order, searching the
last 8 to 16 contexts for the longest match.
The effect is usually greatest for low order PPM.

<p><a href=http://mosoi.lumina.ro/index.php/plain/projects/chile>chile</a> 0.3d-1 is a free,
command line file compressor as C source code by Alexandru Mosoi, May 29, 2006.
It uses BWT.  The option -b40000 selects a block size of 40000 KB, which requires about
785 MB of memory for compression and 240 MB for decompression.  Version 0.3d1
is identical to version 0.3d except that the maximum block size
was increased from 2048 KB to 99999 KB.  For this test the program was compiled for Windows
using MinGW 3.4.2 as specified in the Makefile.

<p><a href=http://alexandru.mosoi.googlepages.com/chile-0.4.tar.gz>chile 0.4</a>
(Jan. 27, 2007)
introduces a faster algorithm for building suffix arrays that uses less memory (7N).
The option -b=244141 selects the block size in Kb (to split enwik9 in 4 equal parts).
It was compiled using MinGW gcc 3.4.5 with options -W -Wall -fomit-frame-pointer -g -O3
and tested in WinXP Home with 2 GB memory.

<p>rings 0.3 was released Dec. 21, 2007.

<p>rings 1.0 was released Feb. 8, 2008.  It uses 50 MB for compression and 43 MB
for decompression.

<p>rings 1.1 was released Feb. 13, 2008 with same memory usage.  It uses CM with LZP
preprocessing for faster compression.

<p>rings 1.2 was released Mar. 4, 2008 with the same memory usage.

<p>rings 1.3 was released Apr. 2, 2008.  It uses 54 MB for compression and 47 MB for decompression.

<p>rings 1.4c was released Apr. 14, 2008.  It has an option (1-9) which selects
memory usage.  Each increment doubles usage.  Memory usage and run time are greater
for decompression than compression.  For option 9, compression uses 526 MB and
decompression uses 789 MB.  The program uses BWT.  The transformed data is encoded
using MTF (move to front), pre-Huffman coding followed by arithmetic coding.

<p>rings 1.5 was released Apr. 21, 2008.  It improves compression and is symmetric
with regard to memory usage.  Options are like 1.4c. The table below compares timing
results on my old and new computers.

<p>rings 1.6 was released Aug. 16, 2009. The option ranges from 1 to 10, where
10 uses the most memory. It includes

12.0.0.17 (compression technology version 12.0.0.21) was released Jan. 31, 2008.
It includes lossless compression of JPEG and MP3 files and lossy recompression
of zip archives, GIF, TIFF, PNG, and PDF files.  It supports a native SITX format
as well as zip, gzip, rar, bzip2, compress, tar, cab, and some more obscure
formats.  It is multithreaded for multicore support, although I tested it on
a single core processor.  I only tested
the native general-purpose formats.  For these tests, I used the command
line programs console_stuff.exe and console_unstuff.exe to reduce the executable size
and measure run time more accurately.  The options are
-m=1 (LZ77-Huffman), -m=2 (LZ77-arithmetic), -m=4 (PPM), -m=8 (BWT), -l (level 2-16,
higher is slower but better), -x (memory extents, max 30, higher uses more memory).
The best compression for text is -m=4 (PPM) with maximum
memory -x=30.  (In the GUI but not the command line, above 29 causes an out of memory
error with 2 GB RAM).  The -l option apparently has no effect on PPM.
The decompresser size is based on console_unstuff.exe and the minumum set of
5 .dll files needed to run it (4 common plus Plugins/sitx.dll).
The full GUI installer (without Office plugins)
zips to 17,051,856 bytes.  The tested version was a complimentary copy provided
by the company.

<p>Stuffit 2009 13.0.0.19 (compression technology 13.0.0.24) was released Dec. 19, 2008.
I tested as with Stuffit 12, however the technique of finding the minimal set
of .dll files that I used in Stuffit 12 did not work (internal error)
so I had to include the zipped distribution
size (StuffIt2009.exe), which includes many other compression formats and a GUI.
The tested version was a complimentary copy provided by the company.

<a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1504-Crook-a-new-binary-PPM-compressor>(discussion)</a>
is a free, open source file compressor by Jüri Valdmann, Mar. 5, 2012.
It uses bit-level PPM.
Because it predicts bits rather than bytes, there is no
escape modeling. This is like DMC in that each bit-level context
is mapped to a next-bit prediction and a
count (equvalent to two counts of zeros and ones). But 
unlike DMC, it avoids the problem of duplicate states representing
the same contexts, which would dilute the statistics and waste memory.

<p>Bits are modeled MSB first.
Contexts are stored in a binary tree where the two child nodes
represent the current context extended by one bit on the right. Each node also has a
pointer to a suffix node, representing the current context shortened by
one byte on the left. Contexts always begin on byte boundaries.
Each context maps to a 22 bit prediction for the next bit
(initialized to 0.5) and a count. When a bit is coded, the
current node and all of its suffix nodes are updated by adjusting the
prediction to reduce the error by 1/count and the count is incremented
by 1 up to a limit of 32. The initial tree is bytewise order 0 (255 contexts)
with initial counts of 12. Subsequent nodes are added with a count of 1.5
and a prediction inherited from its suffix node
whenever there is no node to represent the 1 bit extension, and the new node becomes
the current context.

<p>The option -m1600 limits memory usage to 1600 MiB. When memory is exhausted,
no new nodes are added to the tree, but predictions and counts of existing
nodes continue to be updated. The current context then becomes the suffix
node if needed. The option -O8 limits the tree depth to bytewise
order 8 (found to be optimal for both enwik8 and enwik9). When the current
node reaches this depth, no child nodes are added, but existing nodes and
their suffixes continue to be updated, just as if the memory limit were reached.
Increasing the model order improves
compression but also causes the tree to grow faster, which sometimes makes compression
worse if the memory limit is reached sooner. The defaults are -m128 -O4.

<p>Compression and decompression require the same time and memory. Also,
the same compression options must be given again during decompression.
(I added 10 bytes to the decompresser size to account for this). The compressed file
is arithmetic coded with the original file size saved in the first 4 bytes.
File sizes are limited to less than 2 GiB. The program is distributed as
source code only. To test, I compiled with g++ 4.6.1 in 32 bit Windows
using the options recommended in the source comments.

<h3>.1956 enc</h3>

<a href=http://www.compression.ru/so/>enc</a> 0.15 is an experimental,
closed source command line archiver by Serge Osnach, Feb. 14, 2003.  It uses PPM and CM (in PaQ mode).
It tries up to 5 different compression
methods (depending on options) and chooses the best one.  The methods are ("a" means "add to archive"):
<ul>
<li>ae = PPMEnch, default is order 7, -o4 to -o64 overrides, -d selects dictionary size in MB to -d256 (uses 344 MB).
  Choosing higher than -d127 causes decompresser to either output garbage or crash.
<li>ai = PPMd var. I, -o selects PPM order, above -o18 crashes compressor, -d has no effect, uses 18 MB.
<li>aq = PaQ, -o and -d have no effect, uses 50 MB.
<li>ab = PPMBin, default order 15, -o overrides, -d selects dictionary size and crashes decompresser as with method ae.
<li>ao = PPMEnch with fixed settings.  -o and -d have no effect but using -d crashes decompresser.  Uses 31 MB.
<li>ag = try all 5 methods and select the best compression.  Subsets (e.g. "aeqo" = ae, aq, ao) are allowed.
</ul>
Methods ae and ab with options -o8 -d256 were found to give the best compression on enwik7 (first 10<sup>7</sup>
bytes).  These methods discard the model when the memory limit is reached, and this was observed to happen
(in task manager), so these options should hold for larger files.  However with -d127 (necessary to decompress),
method aq gives the best compression.

<h3>.1984 WinRAR</h3>

<a href=http://www.rarlab.com/>WinRAR</a> 3.60 beta 3 is a commercial (free trial)
Windows GUI and command line archiver by Eugene Roshal, May 8, 2006.  
It produces rar and zip archives 
and decompresses many other formats.  It also encrypts and performs other functions.
The best compression mode uses PPM (actually ppmd var. I, an earlier version of ppmd J)
with optimizations for text and other
formats (exe, wav, bmp).  The -mc7:128t+ option says to use PPM order 7,
128 MB memory (maximum) and force text preprocessing.  The -sfxWinCon.sfx
option says to produce a self extracting console executable
(adding 79,360 bytes).

<p>The model order was tuned on enwik8.  Additional results are shown
for order 10,
for -m5 (maximum compression), and for normal compression as a .exe and
.rar file.  The decompresser in the last case is zipped unrar.exe.

<a href=http://www.maximumcompression.com/quark095r.rar>quark v0.95r beta</a> is a free,
closed source command line file compressor by Frederic Bautista, Mar. 10, 2006.
It uses LZ.  It is characterized by high compression and fast decompression.
The -m1 option selects relative mode compression, which is normally best, but slowest.  The
-d25 option selects a dictionary size of 2<sup>25</sup> which is the largest that will
run without thrashing with 1 GB RAM.  The -l8 option selects the search depth.
Higher values normally improve compression (up to -l13, default -l4), but -l8 was the highest
practical value for reasonable compression speed (7.5 hours).  Also, larger values were 
found to hurt compression on enwik5.
Compression time increases approximately exponentially with the -l value.
The compression speed with -l13 is 6,100,000 ns/byte.

<a href=http://heartofcomp.altervista.org/>flashzip</a> 0.1
is a free, closed source file compressor by Nania Francesco Antonio, Jan. 10, 2008.
It uses LZP and arithmetic coding.

<p>flashzip 0.2 was released Jan. 11, 2008.  It is compatible with version 0.1 but faster.
Note: in both versions, CPU utilization during compression is about 28% to 35%.  Times
shown are process times.

<p>flashzip 0.3 was released Feb. 4, 2008.  It uses ROLZ plus arithmetic coding.  It
takes an option x for better compression (slower) and 1 through 5, 
where 5 is the slowest (best compression).

<p>flashzip 0.9 was released June 28, 2008. Option -m2 selects method 2 (default
is -m1). -b1 through -b5 select buffer size, which affects memory usage.
Default is -b3. -s1 through -s7 selects match length and speed. Default is
-s1 (fastest, worst compression).

<p>flashzip 0.91 was released Aug. 17, 2008. Options are like version 0.9.
Memory usage was increased
to 198 MB for compression and 138 MB for decompression using settings for
best compression.  Minimum requirement is 10 MB and 6 MB.

<p><a href=http://www.encode.ru/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=385&d=1236636165>flashzip 0.93a</a>
was released Mar. 9, 2009.

<p>flashzip 0.94 was released Mar. 25, 2009.

<p>flashzip 0.99 was released July 23, 2009.

<p>flashzip 0.99b4 (Aug. 25, 2009) is an archiver rather than a compressor. The -s
option was renamed to -c and the -b option was increased to -b8 to allow more
memory usage. For enwik8, memory usage for both -m1 and -m2 is 182 MB for
compression and 162 MB for decompression.
For enwik9, memory usage for -m2 is 609 MB for compression and 592 MB for decompression.

<p>flashzip 0.99b8 (Feb. 28, 2010) has 4 compression levels from -m0 (fastest) to
-m3 (best). The buffer size option was increased to -b9 (1 GB).
Memory usage depends on the input size.
For -m0 -c7 -b7 enwik8, compression takes 214 MB and decompression takes 195 MB.
For -m1 through -m3 -c7 -b8, enwik8 compression takes 231 MB and decompression takes 195 MB.
For -m3 -c7 -b8, enwik9 compression takes 658 MB and decompression takes 625 MB.
Changing -b8 to -b9 has no effect on size, speed, or memory usage for enwik8,
but for enwik9 it improves compression and increases memory usage to 1111 MB for
compression and 1078 MB for decompression. The -s1 option enables the -b9 option.
Otherwise -b9 will cause a "no memory" error.

<p>flashzip 0.99c1 (June 1, 2011) improves compression and speed. The option ranges
are -m0...-m3, -c1...-c7 and -b1...-b7. Only the maximum compression options were tested.

<p>flashzip 0.99c3 (Oct. 10, 2011) is multi-threaded for compression
in modes -m1, -m2, -m3. Decompression runs in a single thread.
The archive is compatible with the previous version.
In the tested mode (maximum compression), memory usage depends on the file
size and climbs steadily during compression or decompression. It is the
same for either, and same as the previous single threaded version.

<p>flashzip 0.99d1 was released Oct. 31, 2011. It has only two
options, -m0...-m9 (default -m4) for compression method (fastest...best)
and -b1...-b7 (default -b1) for buffer size. Memory usage ranges from
30 MB at -b1 to 1100 MB at -b7.

<p><a href=http://heartofcomp.altervista.org/FLASHZIP/home.htm>
flashzip</a> 1.0.0 was released Oct. 3, 2012. Options -m1 to -m7 select compression
-mx7 compresses best. Higher levels compress
slower and use more memory but have little effect on decompression
speed, which is generally faster. Decompression uses the same memory
as compression, up to 1.1 GB depending on the file size.
Options -b1 to -b7 select buffer size. Larger values
use more memory but don't affect speed. The default is -b4.
The program can use up to 8
threads and auto-detects the number of available cores. In the
high compression modes tested, only 1 of 2 available cores was used.
-e creates a self extracting archive. It extracts to the saved name
using both cores.

<h3>.2065 lzham</h3>

<p><a href=https://code.google.com/p/lzham/>lzham</a> alpha 2 is a free,
open source (MIT license) file compressor and library by Richard Geldreich Jr.,
Aug. 21, 2010. LZHAM is short for LZMA-Huffman-Arithmetic-Markov. It is based
on LZMA (7zip) but instead of using arithmetic coding throughout, it uses them
only for binary decisions and uses Huffman or
<a href=http://www.ezcodesample.com/prefixer/prefixer_article.html>Polar</a>
codes for literal and match codes. A Polar code is similar to a Huffman code
but is simpler to calculate at a cost of 0.1% in compression. Polar codes
are calculated as follows:
<ol>
<li>Symbols are sorted from highest to lowest frequency.
<li>The total frequency is rounded up to a power of 2.
<li>Individual frequencies are rounded down to a power of 2.
<li>Individual frequencies are doubled in descending order until the sum is equal.
<li>Step 4 is repeated as needed.
<li>At this point all codes have frequencies that are a power of 1/2 and codes are assigned.
</ol>
For example, if the symbols and their frequencies are A=3, B=2, C=1, then the sum (6) is
rounded up to 8 and the individual frequencies are rounded down to A=2, B=2, C=1, which
sums to 5. We then double A=4, which sums to 7. We cannot double B=4 because the sum
would exceed 8, so we continue to C. At this point we have A=4, B=2, C=2, which
sums to 8, and we may assign codes of appropriate lengths such as A=0, B=10, C=11.

<p>For this test, lzhamtest_x86 was used. There is a _x64 version for 64 bit machines
which is faster. The library supports different speeds and dictionary sizes, but
the test program does not have any options to select them, so none were used.
Decompression uses 67 MB memory vs. 609 MB for compression.
Compression uses both cores on the test machine
but decompression uses only one.

<p>Version alpha 3, Aug. 30, 2010, supports all of the options suppored by
the library. Option -d26 selects 64M dictionay, the largest supported by
the x86 version. (The x64 version supports up to -d29 = 512M). -m4 selects "uber"
compression mode. There are 5 compression levels from -m0 through -m4.
The highest two levels use Huffman codes rather than Polar codes. -t2 says
to use 2 helper threads (to match the number of cores on the test machine). The
default is to use 1 less than the number of cores, up to 16 threads.
Decompression is not multi-threaded.

<p>The x64 version was <a href=https://code.google.com/p/lzham/wiki/statistics>tested</a>
by the author. I guessed at memory usage. Each increment of the -d option approximately
doubles memory usage.

(<a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1368-Some-of-my-toy-compressors>discussion</a>) is a free,
experimental, open source file compressor by Zhang Li, Sept. 27, 2011. It uses LZSS
(in 4 MB blocks) followed by arithmetic coding. The program takes no arguments. It uses
60 MB memory for compression and 6 MB for decompression. It runs in both Windows and
Linux. Only the Windows version was tested.

<p>Version 20110928 was released Sept. 28, 2011. Compression runs in 2 threads.
Both the Windows and Linux versions were tested (on different computers).

<p>Version 20110929 was released Sept. 29, 2011. Decompression also runs in
2 threads. Compression is slightly improved.

<p>comprox version 0.1.1, Oct. 10, 2011, replaces comprox_sa. It is a rewrite
using LZ77 (instead of LZSS) and arithmetic coding. It takes a compression
level 0 (fastest) to 9 (best) with a default of 5. All levels use the same
memory, 218 MB for compression and 44 MB for decompression. The Linux
version reports the same resident memory as Windows but higher virtual memory:
236 MB to compress and 284 MB to decompress. Both compression and decompression
run in 2 threads. Reported times are real times.

<p><a href=https://comprox.googlecode.com/files/comprox-0.6.0.tar.gz>
comprox 0.6.0</a> was released Aug. 24, 2012. It uses static 4K dictionary
encoding followed by LZ77 and arithmetic coding. It was released as open
source (3 clause BSD) C code only. For testing, it was compiled using g++ 4.6.1
as "gcc -O3 *.c" under 32 bit Windows. The option e200 means to use a 200 MiB
block size. The default is e16. Larger blocks improve compression but use
more memory. The program crashed with e250 or larger.

comprox 0.7.0</a>
<a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1378-comprox-0-1?p=30333&viewfull=1#post30333>(discussion)</a>
was released Sept. 10, 2012. It includes multi-threaded
compression and other improvements. It includes a static English
dictionary with about 3000 common words.
It was tested in 64 bit Linux compiled
with "gcc -O3 *.c -lpthread" and in 32 bit Windows compiled with
"gcc -O3 *.c -lpthread -Wl,--stack,8000000".

<p><a href=http://code.google.com/p/comprox/>comprox</a> v0.8.0 was
released Sept. 26, 2012 with better compression. The Linux version
was compiled with "gcc -O3 -march=native *.c -lpthread". The Windows
version was compiled as before.

<p>comprox 0.8.0-bugfix1, Sept. 27, 2012, fixed a bug that caused compression
to crash on some input files. It was compiled with MinGW 4.6.1 with
"gcc -O3 -msse2 -s -Wl,--stack,8000000 *.c -lpthread".

<p><a href=http://comprox.googlecode.com/files/comprox-0.9.0.tar.gz>
comprox 0.9.0</a> was released Oct. 16, 2012. The -b option sets the
block size in MB. Default is -b16. -m sets number of matches to
check. Default is -m40. -f selects flexible parsing. To test, the
program was compiled "gcc -O3 -march=native -s *.c" as above.

<h3>.2088 TarsaLZP</h3>

<p><a href=http://asembler.republika.pl/bin/TarsaLZP.zip>TarsaLZP Aug 8 2007</a>
is a free, experimental file compressor with public domain source code (FASM)
by Piotr Tarsa.

<p>Older versions used order 3 LZP to code the last 16 matches at order 3,
followed by order 2 PPM encoding of literals. 
It takes no command line options but compression/decompression settings may be specified in
an initialization file.  For this test, default settings were used and others were not tried.

<p>The Jul 30 2007 version uses 2 LZP models, one with a 4 byte context and one 8 byte.
The program selects the one that gives a higher probability of a match.  There is no
initialization file.

<p>The Aug 8 2007 version uses 341 MB memory for compression and 333 MB for decompression.

<p>The interim <a href=http://www.zippyshare.com/v/37878366/TarsaLZPInterim.zip.html>Aug 10 2007</a>
version runs at high priority.  (CAUTION, this will make your computer unusable while running).

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1478-TarsaLZP?p=28145#post28145>
TarsaLZP 29 Jan 2012</a> is distributed as Java source and class files. It has a GUI interface.

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1603-TarsaLZP-yet-again?p=31446&viewfull=1#post31446>
TarsaLZP 18 Nov 2012</a> takes several options, but defaults were used for testing.
It is available as source code in Python, Java, Javascript, and C. The C version
was tested by compiling with MinGW gcc 4.7.0 with options "-O3 -std=c99" in 32 bit Vista.

<h3>.2118 xz</h3>

<p><a href=http://tukaani.org/xz/>xz</a> 5.0.1 is a free, open source file compressor,
Jan. 29, 2011. xz specifies a container format written by Lasse Collin. It uses
the public domain LZMA2 compressed format from 7zip by Igor Pavlov. There are
versions for most operating systems including Windows and Linux. The Windows
version was tested. The option -9 specifies maximum compression and
memory. The default is -6. The option -e (extreme) specifies better compression
at a cost in compression (but not decompression) time.

<p>Program size is based on xz.exe. There is a separate decompressor (xzdec.exe)
which is smaller and decompresses to standard output, but the Windows version
does not work because it outputs in text mode. Additional results are shown below
for enwik8 for compression and decompression time (ns/byte) and compression
and decompression memory (in MB).

<h3>.2120 CTW</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.ele.tue.nl/ctw/>CTW</a> 0.1 is a free, command line file compressor with source
code by Erik Franken and Marcel Peeters, Nov. 13, 2002.  It uses CTW (context tree weighting),
a type of context-mixing algorithm (with single bit prediction and arithmetic coding) combining
the predictions of different order contexts.  Statistics are stored in a suffix tree.

<p>The -d6 option selects order 6 (depth of context tree).  -n16M selects the maximum of 16M nodes
for the tree (using 128 MB memory).  -f16M selects the maximum 16 MB file buffer 
(for rebuilding pruned contexts).  The default values of all other options were tested on
enwik6 and found optimal.  For -d, there is a tradeoff between compression and memory usage
as with PPM compressors.  -d6 was found optimal on both enwik7 and enwik8.

<h3>.2174 lzturbo</h3>

<a href=http://www.consultant-berater.de/lzturbo-0.0.1.tar.gz>lzturbo 0.01</a> is
a free, experimental, closed source file compressor by Hamid Bouzidi, Aug. 15, 2007.
It uses LZ77 with arithmetic coding.  The option -49 selects method 4 (1, 2, 4)
and level 9 (1..9) for best compression.  Other combinations were not tested.
There is also a Linux version which was not tested.
Memory usage fluxuates but peaks at 654 MB for compression and 90 MB for decompression.
The Windows version produces read-only output files that must be set with
"attrib -r" before they can be modified or deleted.

<p>lzturbo 0.1 (Oct. 5, 2007)
is threaded for parallel execution on multicore machines.  The maximum
comprssion level is -59 where it uses 248 MB for compression and a peak
of 72 MB for decompression.  Other modes compress much faster.  The read-only
bug was fixed.

<p><a href=http://consultant-berater.de/lzturbo/>lzturbo 0.9</a>
was released Feb. 25, 2008.  Decompression memory peaks at 79 MB.

<p><a href=http://lzturbo.web.officelive.com/documents/lzturbo.zip>lzturbo 0.94</a>
was released Apr. 11, 2009. The option -b59 selects method 5, compression level 9
for maximum compression. -b100 selects a block size of 100 MB for independent
compression in separate threads. The default is 32 MB. -p0 forces the
compressor to run on one core. By default the program runs on on all cores, but
this causes the program to run out of memory with -59 because each thread uses 1450 MB.
Decompression ran on 2 cores with a process time of 20 seconds per core
and wall time of 28 seconds using about 300 MB memory. Faster modes tested
below are run on 2 cores with average process time per core shown.

is an experimental open source (GPL) command line file compressor by
Ilia Muraviev and Jan Ondrus, May 21, 2006.  The -m3 option selects maximum compression.
The -e0 option turns off the exe filter (has no effect on text).  The -r3 and -a0 options
were tuned experimentally on enwik7.  -r sets the rescale rate (range 1-5, default 3).
-a0 turns off the alternate one byte matcher (default -a1 = on).

<h3>.2185 acb</h3>

<a href=http://ctxmodel.net/files/ACB.rar>acb</a>
<a href=http://encode.dreamhosters.com/showthread.php?t=540>(discussion)</a>
is a shareware archiver for DOS by George Buyanovsky. It achieved some popularity
in Russia in 1997 after being described in a popular magazine there.
acb uses a complex variant
of LZ77 called "associative coding". (ACB means "associative coding by Buyanovsky").
History is collected in a context sorted ring (like BWT) called a "funnel of
analogies". A string match is coded by the position of the longest (nearest) match in this
data structure. The length is coded dependent on the length of neighboring matches.
The result is arithmetic coded. There are 4 versions:
<ul>
<li>acb 1.02c, Apr. 12, 1995, does simple archiving and multi-volume archiving
where the archive is split into equal sized files. It requires 7.6 MB of memory.
Source code is included for this version only.
<li>acb 1.17a, Feb. 15, 1996, has 3 compression modes: "B" fast, "b" default,
and "u" maximum or slowest. It also adds error correction and detection and
password protection. It uses 15 MB memory. It also has a "taught channel" mode
used to patch files. In this mode
a separate file is used to train the compressor and must be present during
decompression.
<li>acb 1.23c was released June 23, 1996.
<li>acb 2.00a was released Apr. 25, 1997. This is the version tested
with option "u" for maximum compression.
</ul>
All versions limit file size to 64 MB but do not limit archive size. To
test enwik8, it was divided into 2 equal parts of 50 MB and compressed into
one archive. Archives are compressed in "solid" mode.
enwik9 was divided into 16 equal parts of 62.5 MB each
(named 01 through 16)
and compressed to 16 separate archives. The compressor crashed (after 12 hours
and producing 1474 MB output in 3 files) with
an illegal interrupt when attempting to compress enwik9 into a single archive.

(60 day trial) GUI archiver by SpeedProject, Apr. 11, 2006.
It supports 13 different formats, but only
the native .sqx (possibly LZ77) format was tested.  The options used were 2.0 format (newest),
32 MB dictionary (largest, actually uses 365 MB memory), Ultra compression (best),
and all checkboxes off (including no exe or multimedia compression).  There is a SFX
option but using UnSqueez to decompress instead gives a smaller size.

<h3>.2212 fpaq2</h3>

<p>fpaq0s2 is a
free, open source (GPL) file compressor by Nania Francesco Antonio, Sept, 29, 2006.
It is an order 2 model based on the order 0 compressor fpaq0s by David A. Scott, 
which is based on fpaq0 by Matt Mahoney by modifying the arithmetic coder.  
fpaq0x is the same order 2 model based directly on fpaq0.

<p>fpaq0x1a is an order 3 model (hashed context) using fpaq0's arithmetic coder.
fpaq0s2b is a similar model based on fpaq0s.  Both were released Oct. 1, 2006.

<p>fpaq0x1b (Oct. 6, 2006) switches between different models up to order 3.

<p>fpaq0s3 (Oct. 8, 2006) uses a simple order 0 model on groups of 3 bytes.

<p>fpaq0s4 (Oct. 12, 2006) uses a combined order 0-1-2, PPM and LZ model.

<p>fpaq0s5 (Oct. 15, 2006) improves on fpaq0s4.  Memory usage is 200 MB when
run at normal priority and 160 MB when run at below normal priority (WinXP Home).

<p>fpaq2 (Oct. 21, 2006) uses a combination context mixing and PPM algorithm.

<p>fpaq0s6 (Oct. 30, 2006) improves on fpaq0s5.

<p>fastari (Nov. 7, 2006) is an order 2 compressor with an all new arithmetic coder
and greater speed.

<p>fpaq3 (Nov. 20, 2006) is an order 3 compressor.

<p>fpaq3b (Dec. 2, 2006) is a bitwise order 28 compressor.

<p>fpaq3c (Dec. 21, 2006) is an improved bitwise order 28 compressor.

<p>fpaq3d (Dec. 28, 2006) adds an option to fpaq3c to select memory
usage from 16 MB to 2 GB.  Option 6 selects 1 GB memory (the highest tested).

<h3>.2217 TinyCM</h3>

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1620-TinyCM-A-simple-CM-compressor?p=30824#post30824>
TinyCM 0.1</a> is a free, open source (GPL v3) file compressor by David Werecat,
Oct. 12, 2012. It uses an order 1-2-3-6 context mixing model. It takes one
option, a single digit "level" which apparently has no effect except to store
the value in the first byte of the archive. (I used "9"). Memory is the
same for compression and decompression. The supplied executables require
MSVCR110.dll, which I did not have, so I recompiled the source code
with g++ 4.6.1 using "gcc -O3 -march=native -s *.c -I." on a 2.0 GHz T3200
under 32 bit Vista.

<h3>.2218 plzip</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/plzip.html>plzip</a> is a free, open source
file compressor by Antonio Diaz Diaz, Feb. 16, 2010. It is "parallel lzip", compatible
with <a href=http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/lzip.html>lzip</a>, but multi-threaded for
parallel execution. It uses LZMA (LZ77 with arithmetic coding). The -9 option
selects maximum compression. It has a command line interface similar to gzip.
When it compresses, it removes the original file and adds a .lz extension.

<p>lzip and plzip are written for Linux. A
<a href=http://encode.dreamhosters.com/showthread.php?t=570>Windows port</a> by
Christian Schnaader on May 2, 2010 was tested. On my test computer (2 core T3200, 2 GHz),
compression showed 180% CPU and decompression showed 117%.

<h3>.2226 dmc</h3>

<a href=http://www.jjj.de/crs4/dmc.c>dmc</a> is the original DMC
compressor written by Gordon V. Cormack in 1987 and described in
"Data Compression using Dynamic Markov Modelling",
by Gordon Cormack and Nigel Horspool in Computer Journal 30:6 (December 1987).
The algorithm is the same as described in <a href=#1998>hook</a> with the
last 2 arguments fixed at "2 2".  The dmc argument "c 1800000000" means to
compress with 1.8 GB memory.  The memory size must also be given for decompression.
Thus, 10 bytes (the size of the argument) was added to the decompresser size
(source zipped with Info-Zip 2.31 -9).
Because dmc compresses and decompresses
from stdin to stdout, it was tested in Linux (Ubuntu
2.6.15.27-amd64-generic), compiled in gcc 4.0.3 x86-64 as follows:
<pre>
  gcc -O -s -Dexp=expand dmc.c
</pre>
and tested on a 2.2 GHz Athlon-64 with 2 GB memory.  The compiler argument
"-Dexp=expand" removes a compiler error due to a K&R style redefinition of exp().

<h3>.2276 szip</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.compressconsult.com/szip/>szip</a> 1.12a is a free, open source
file compressor by Michael Schindler, Mar. 3, 2000. It uses a modified BWT
(a Schindler transform) which sorts using a truncated string comparison to speed
the transform on highly redundant data. The algorithm is protected by
<a href=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6199064/claims.html>patent 6,199,064</a> in the U.S.
until Nov. 19, 2017. The first version of szip was released on June 2, 1997.

<p>The option -b41o16 selects a block size of 4.1 MB (the maximum) and order 16, the maximum
length of string comparisons. Memory usage is 17 MB (4x block size) for compression
and 21 MB (5x block size) for decompression. o0 means unbounded order, which is the
same as a normal BWT. The default is -b16o6.

<h3>.2299 qazar</h3>

<a href=http://qarc.narod.ru/>qazar</a> 0.0pre5 is a free, closed source
command line file compressor by
Denis Kyznetsov, Jan. 31, 2006.  It uses LZP, an LZ77 variant where
the decompresser dynamically computes the same sequence of context
matches as the compressor.  The compressor uses a single bit flag
to indicate if the pointer computed by the decompresser should be
followed.  In qazar, the output symbols are arithmetic coded.

<p>The -d9 option selects maximum dictionary size.  -x7 selects
maximum hash level (most memory).  -l7 selects maximim search level
(slowest).

<h3>.2299 csc32</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.encode.ru/forum/showthread.php?t=337>csc2</a> is a free,
experimental, closed source file compressor by Fu Siyuan, Apr. 18, 2009.
It uses LZP with order 1 modeling of literals and range coding over a 270
size alphabet. The program takes no options. It recognizes whether the input
file is compressed, and if so, decompresses it.

<p><a href=http://www.encode.ru/forum/showthread.php?t=425>csc3</a> v.2009.08.12
is a free file
compressor with source code in C by Fu Siyuan, Aug. 11, 2009. It uses LZ77. The
option -m3 selects best and slowest compression
(range -m1 to -m3, default -m2). -d7 selects the maximum dictionary size
(range -d1 to -d7, default -d4). -fo turns off EXE and delta filtering
(default unless detected by file name extension).
The decompresser size is based on csc3.exe, which is smaller than csc3compile2.exe,
but does not work on some machines. It is smaller than the zipped source code (17,247 bytes).
Timing is similar for both versions and a version compiled with gcc 4.4 with -O2
-s -march=pentium4 -fomit-frame-pointer.

<h3>.2356 dzo</h3>

<p><a href=http://essensolabs.com/>dzo</a> is a commercial GUI deduplicator and archiver
for Windows by Essenso Labs. A beta version (32 day free trial)
dated Sept. 15, 2011 was tested. The trial version will compress either a single file
or a folder. It first finds duplicate files or regions within files and produces an
intermediate temporary file (<i>file.dp</i>) that removes the duplicates. Then it compresses
the temporary file using LZMA (7zip) to <i>file.dzo</i> and removes it.
The original files are not removed. Decompression restores a single file
to <i>(dzo)file</i> or <i>folder(dzo)</i>, again through a temporary .dp file. Both
commands are activated by right-clicking on the file or folder to compress or the .dzo
file to decompress and selecting the command from the context menu. Times are as reported
by the appliation. LZMA compression is multi-threaded.

(<a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1368-Some-of-my-toy-compressors>discussion</a>) is a free,
experimental, open source file compressor by Zhang Li, Sept. 27, 2011. It uses
<a href=http://mattmahoney.net/dc/dce.html#Section_559>BWTS</a>
(BWT Scottified) with 4 MB blocks, followed by MTF (move to front), RLEZ (run length encoding
of zeros) and arithmetic coding. BWTS is a bijective variant of BWT developed by David
A. Scott in which the starting index is not stored. In BWTS, the input is factored into
a sequence of lexicographically non-decreasing Lyndon words, which are then context-sorted
separately. The starting indexes for the inverse BWTS are the beginnings of each word.

<p>The program takes no arguments. It uses 103 MB (24x block size) for compression and
25 MB (6x block size) for decompression. There is a Windows and a Linux version.
Only the Windows version was tested.

<p>comprox_ba 20110928 was released Sept. 28, 2011. Compression runs in 2 threads. Both the Windows
and Linux versions were tested (on different computers).

<p>comprox_ba 20110929 was released Sept. 29, 2011. Compression is slightly improved.
Both compression and decompression are now multi-threaded.

<h3>.2508 cabarc</h3>

<a href=http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;en-us;310618>cabarc</a> 1.00.0601
is a command line archiver available for free download by Microsoft, Mar. 18, 1997
(SDK released Jan. 8, 2002).  It produces .cab files, which are often used to distribute Microsoft software.
It is designed for very fast decompression.
It uses LZX, a variant of LZ77 with fixed Huffman coding, but with shorter symbols reserved for the
three most recent matches.  The option -m lzx:21 selects a window size of 2<sup>21</sup>
(2 MB) for maximum compression.
There is a separate extraction program, "extract".  The actual (global) decompression time of 32 sec. includes
15 sec. of CPU (process) time and the rest for disk I/O.

<h3>.2530 sr3</h3>

<a href=sr2.zip>sr2</a> is a free,
open source (GPL) file compressor by Matt Mahoney, Aug. 3, 2007.  It uses
symbol ranking.  It takes no options.  There are separate programs for
compression and decompression.

<p>Compression is as follows.
A 20-bit hashed order-4 context is mapped into the last 3 bytes seen
in that context in a move-to-front queue, plus a consecutive hit count.
Queue positions (hits) or literals (misses) are arithmetic coded using
the count and an an order-1 context (order-0 if the count is more than 3)
as secondary context.  After a byte is coded, it is moved to the front of the queue.
The hit count is updated as follows: incremented (max 63) if the first byte
is matched, set to 1 if any other byte is matched, or set to 0 in case of a miss.

<p><a href=http://www.winturtle.netsons.org/>sr3</a>
<a href=sr3.zip>(mirror)</a>
is a modification by
Nania Francesco Antonio, Oct. 28, 2007.  The context table size is increased
from 4 MB to 64 MB, which effectively increases the context from order-4 to
order-5.  This helps compression on larger files, but makes it worse for some
smaller files.  The program also detects file type.  For .bmp files, the order is
decreased.  For .wav files, the input is split into separate 1 byte wide streams
for each audio sample.  There is no separate compressor and decompresser program.

<p>sr3.exe was recompiled on July 23, 2009
without upack to remove antivirus false alarms, resulting
in a larger executable. The new size is shown using source code.

<a href=http://encode.ru/attachment.php?attachmentid=1733&d=1322071572>RangeCoderC v1.2</a>
<a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1411-Simple-Variable-Order-Rangecoder?p=27267#post27267>(discussion)</a>
is a free, experimental open source file compressor by David Catt,
Nov. 23, 2011. The option 26 selects a simple bitwise order 26 model.
An order n model requires 16*2<sup>n</sup> bytes of memory.

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/attachment.php?attachmentid=1734&d=1322237740>RangeCoderC v1.3</a>,
Nov. 25, 2011, has 3 versions. The standard version is compatible with v1.2 but
uses half as much memory. The "double" version uses a main model to select
among several sub-models to improve compression at a cost in speed and memory.
There is also an "indirect" version that was not tested because there was no
32 bit Windows version.

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/attachment.php?attachmentid=1739&d=1322498413>
RangeCoderC v1.4</a> was released Nov. 28, 2011. It has 4 versions: standard,
double, indirect, and a new version, hashed, which computes a hashed context
and gives the best compression.

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/attachment.php?attachmentid=1741&d=1322594561>
RangeCoderC v1.5</a> was released Nov. 29, 2011. It combines the 4
models from v1.4 into one program and includes the model type in the archive header.
Option c3 selects the hashed model. It gives the same size as v1.4. The other
models were not tested.

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/attachment.php?attachmentid=1746&d=1322766090>
RangeCoderC v1.6</a> was released Dec. 1, 2011. It has 6 compression modes
selected by options c0 through c5 as follows:
<pre>
0 - Simple Bitwise Model (default)
1 - Indirect Bitwise Model
2 - Indexed Bitwise Model Array
3 - Hashed Bitwise Model
4 - Bitwise Linear CM
5 - Bitwise Linear CM With SSE
</pre>
c1 failed on enwik8. It produced a "compressed" file about 2.5 GB which decompressed
incorrectly. The other modes were tested at the highest order allowed by the
2 GB memory space available in the 32 bit version.

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/attachment.php?attachmentid=1754&d=1323090055>
RangeCoderC v1.7 alpha</a>, Dec. 5, 2011, fixes the bug in c1 mode in v1.6.
The other 5 modes are presumably the same and were not tested.
It is a pre-release of version 1.7, released without source code.

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/attachment.php?attachmentid=1759&d=1323436295>
RangeCoderC v1.7</a>, Dec. 9, 2011, adds two new compression modes:
<pre>
6 - Bytewise Hashed Model
7 - Combined Model
</pre>
The Bytewise Hashed model uses the hash and cache structure from ZPAQ to achieve high speeds,
even at higher orders. The Combined Model uses the same structure as the Double Model but has
a hashed context and outputs its predictions into a SSE model for better compression.

<p><a href=http://encode.ru/attachment.php?attachmentid=1767&d=1323796993>
RangeCoderC v1.8</a>, Dec. 13, 2011, removes two obsolete modes and adds
one mode: "The Bitwise Adaptive Model uses probabilities instead of counts,
which are adjusted nonlinearly for better compression on changing data.
The learning speed of the model is derived from the model order." The
modes are:
<pre>
0 - Bytewise Hashed Model
1 - Simple Bitwise Model (default)
2 - Adaptive Bitwise Model
3 - Indexed Bitwise Model Array
4 - Hashed Bitwise Model
5 - Combined Model
</pre>
Only the new mode (c2) was tested.

<h3>.2561 quad</h3>

<p><a href=http://quad.sourceforge.net/>quad</a> is a free file compressor by
Ilia Muraviev.  Only the latest version (now open source) is supported, so only that version
appears in the main table.

<p>As described by the author:
QUAD uses ROLZ compression (Reduced Offset LZ). It makes use of an order-2 context to 
reduce the offset set that is matched to. This can be regarded as a fast large 
dictionary LZ. Literals and Match Lengths fits in a single alphabet which is coded 
using an order-2-0 PPM with Full Exclusion. Match indexes are coded using an order-0 
model. QUAD uses a 16 MB dictionary. For selectable compression speed and ratio, QUAD 
uses different parsing schemes: with Normal mode (Default) QUAD uses a Lazy Matching; 
with Max mode (-x option) QUAD uses a variant of Flexible Parsing. In addition, QUAD 
has an E8/E9 transformer for better executable compression which is always enabled. 

<p>quad 1.01a (Dec. 24, 2006) used LZ77.  It was closed source and took no options.

<p>quad 1.04a (Feb. 8, 2007) used LZP.  Memory was expanded for this version
only, however it is no longer supported.

<p>quad 1.07beta (Feb. 22, 2007)
included the "x" option for better compression.

<p>quad 1.08 was released Mar. 12, 2007.  Quad became open source.

<p>quad 1.10 was released Mar. 19, 2007.  -x selects maximum compression.

<p>quad 1.11 (Apr. 4, 2007) uses ROLZ.

<p><a href=http://www.encode.ru/downloads/quad-1.11HASH2.zip>quad 1.11HASH2</a>
(Apr. 5, 2007, experimental, no source code) produces the same size archives, but uses
a hash table for faster compression.

<p>quad 1.12 was released Apr. 7, 2007.

<h3>.2572 WinACE</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.winace.com/>WinACE</a> 2.61 is a shareware GUI/command line archiver,
Mar. 8, 2006.  It compresses in ACE and ZIP formats and decompresses
many others.  ACE decompresses much faster than it compresses,
suggesting it is based on LZ77.  The option -m5 selects maximum compression.
-d4096 select maximum dictionary size of 4MB (default is -1024 = 1MB).
-sfx creates a self extracting archive, which adds less space than the
program itself.

<h3>.2588 tornado</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.haskell.org/bz/tor.rar>tornado 0.1</a> is a free, open source file
compressor by Bulat Ziganshin, Apr. 16, 2007.  It uses LZ77 with arithmetic coding.
The -9 option selects a predefined compression profile for maximum compression.  
There are custom options for hash table size, hash chain length, block size, type
of coder, and an option to force or prohibit cache matching.  Some of these options
might give better compression, but were not tested.

<p><a href=http://www.haskell.org/bz/tornado03.zip>tornado 0.3</a> has options -1
through -12.  Each increment approximately doubles compression time and memory usage.
Decompression time is fast in all cases, but memory usage is approximately 2/3 that
of compression (for the LZ77 buffer).  -12 caused disk thrashing and was not tested
for enwik9.  There are several other options that were not tested.

<p><a href=http://haskell.org/bz/>tornado</a> <a href=http://haskell.org/bz/tornado04a.zip>0.4a</a>
was released June 1, 2008. It includes Windows and Linux versions. There is a small
version (tor-small.exe) which does not include some of the advanced options.
The advanced options were not tested. Option -12 caused disk thrashing (2 GB memory)
when enwik9 reached 80% compression, so -11 was used instead.

<h3>.2924 irolz</h3>
<a href=http://ezcodesample.com/rolz/rolz_article.html>irolz</a>
<a href=http://ezcodesample.com/rolz/irolz.txt>source code</a> is a free,
open source (GPL), experimental file compressor by Andrew Polar, Sept. 26, 2010.
It uses ROLZ. The algorithm is like LZ77 except that match offsets are coded
by counting previous occurrences of the current context in the history buffer
rather than as pointers. In irolz, the context is order 2. Previous occurrences
are stored in a linked list with a maximum length of 31 (5 bit offset). Matches
less than 4 bytes are coded as literals. Symbols (match flags, 5 bit offsets,
8 bit lengths, and 8 bit literals) are binary arithmetic coded. Lengths and literals
are coded in an order 2 context model. Match flags and offset counts are modeled
without context.
Each symbol and context to be predicted is mapped to 2 16-bit predictions, one
fast adapting (learning rate 1/8) and one slow adapting (rate 1/64). The prediction
is the average of the two.

<p>Only source code is available. For this test, the program irolz.cpp was
compiled using g++ 4.5.0 on a 2 GHz T3200 under 32 bit Vista with
options -O2 -march=pentiumpro -fomit-frame-pointer -s.

<a href=http://de.geocities.com/ocamyd/>symbra</a> 0.2 is a free, open source (GPL)
<a href=symbra02.zip>(mirror with .exe)</a>
file compressor by Frank Schwellinger, Nov. 29, 2007.  It uses symbol ranking.
Only source code (C++) is provided. For the test, the program was compiled
as indicated in the source comments and tested in Windows XP (32 bit).
The option -c4 or -c5 selects order 4 or 5 context.  -m5 turns on suffix
matching with maximum buffer size, which greatly slows compression.  -p2 selects
2 passes, which reorders the alphabet by descending frequency.  The defaults
are -c4 -m0 -p1.

<p>lcssr 0.2 (Dec. 3, 2007, same website) 
<a href=lcssr02.zip>(mirror with .exe)</a>
is derived from symbra.  It drops the secondary symbol queue
and instead uses a variable length context based on the length of the
longest match as with LZ77/LZP.  The option -b7 selects a 1152 MB buffer
for finding context matches.

<h3>.3062 lazy</h3>
<a href=http://mattmahoney.net/dc/lazy100.zip>lazy v1.00</a>
is a free, open source file compressor by Matt Mahoney, Oct. 10, 2012.
It uses LZ77. It has 5 compression levels from 1 to 5. Higher levels
are slower and use more memory to compress. However decompression speed
does not change and always uses 16 MB.

<p>The LZ77 format codes literals uncompressed after a length code.
Matches can have an offset in the range 1 to 2<sup>24</sup>-1 and length
4 to 2<sup>24</sup>-1. Literals are coded as 00,N,L[N], where N is the number
of literals to follow coded in marked binary. A marked binary number
discards the leading 1, then precedes each bit by a 1 and marks the
end with a 0 bit. For example, 5=101 would be coded as 1,0,1,1,0.
Matches are coded as 5 bits to indicate the number of offset bits
(where the first 2 bits are not 00) in the range 0..23, then the match
length as a marked binary number except for the last 2 bits, then the
low 2 bits of the match length are coded directly,
and then 0 to 23 bits of the offset without the leading 1 bit.

<p>Compression is achieved in a 16 MB sliding window implemented as a
pair of buffers. A hash table of 2<sup>19</sup> buckets of 2<sup>level</sup> (2..32) pointers each,
indexed by an order 4 context hash, maintains pointers for finding matches.
The longest match of length at least 4 is coded, except that if the offset
is over 64K and the last symbol is a match, then the minimum length is 5.

<h3>.3099 zhuff</h3>
<a href=http://phantasie.tonempire.net/pc-compression-f2/zhuff-fast-compression-t99.htm#155>zhuff</a>
<a href=http://img49.xooimage.com/files/d/7/a/zhuff-165bce2.zip>0.1</a>
is a free file compressor for Windows by Yann Collet, Dec. 13, 2009. It is described as
a combination of LZ4 and Huff0, a fast Huffman coder. LZ4 uses LZSS, an LZ77 variant
using flags to identify matches and literals. It requires the Microsoft runtime libraries,
which are not included in the program size shown.

<p>zhuff 0.7</a>,
Mar. 15, 2011, is multithreaded.
It automatically detects the number of cores and compressses or decompresses in parallel,
or the number can be changed with -t.
However, since the program is already faster than disk I/O with one thread, using more
threads makes no difference in practice. Speeds shown below are total process times.
Actual times are 17 seconds to compress and 44 to decompress
with either -t1 or -t2. Compressed size is the same either way
and the archives are compatible but not identical.

<p><a href=http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/p/zhuff.html>zhuff 0.8</a>
<a href=http://encode.ru/threads/521-Zhuff-fast-compression>(discussion)</a>
has 3 compression levels, from -c0 (fastest) to -c2 (best). All are multithreaded, but
decompression at all levels and compression with -c0 is I/O bounded (about 40 seconds).
Times are process times for these cases, and real times for -c1 and -c2 compression.

command line compressor by Ken Silverman, compiled May 13, 2006,
released May 18, 2006.  It is an optimizing compressor producing
zip-compatible archives but with better compression.  The option /b512 sets the
block splitting threshold.  The default is /b256, but /b512 was found optimal
on enwik8.  /s0 (default) selects maximum compression and ranges from /s0
to /s3.  No decompresser is included, but archives can be read with any
program that reads zip files (pkzip, unzip, 7zip, WinRAR, WinACE, etc).

<h3>.3128 uc2</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.nicodevries.com/nico/professional.php>uc2</a> (UltraCompressor II
revision 3 pro) is a commercial (free for noncommercial use) command line and GUI 
archiver for DOS by Nico de Vries, June 1, 1995.  It uses LZ77 and Huffman coding.
The -tst option selects maximum compression.

<p>uc2 includes a program for converting archives to self extracting
programs (uc2sea) which produced smaller files (enwik8.exe = 35,397,343 bytes,
enwik9.exe = 312,759,499 bytes), but in this mode decompression failed for enwik9,
truncating the last 21 bytes of output.  uc2sea works by first extracting the
archive and then recompressing it using a slightly different algorithm.

<h3>.3229 pigz</h3>

<p><a href=http://zlib.net/pigz/>pigz</a> 2.2.3 is a free command-line file compressor for Linux,
Jan. 15, 2012. It uses the deflate (LZ77) format for compatibility with gzip, but is multi-threaded
for better speed at a small cost in compression ratio. -9 selects best compression.

<p>pigz is distributed as source code only. It requires linking with <a href=http://zlib.net/>zlib</a>
version 1.2.3 or higher. For this test, pigz was compiled using the supplied Makefile under Ubuntu
Linux with g++ 4.6.1 and linked to zlib 1.2.5. Decompression was tested with unpigz, compiled
similarly. It was tested on a 2.66 GHz Core i7 M620 (2 cores x 2 hyperthreads per core) as in note 48. Virtual
memory usage was measured with top at 115 MB for compression and 33 MB for decompression. Resident memory
usage was 2 MB. Compression time is real time at about 350% CPU usage. Decompression is I/O bound
(less than 100% CPU), so CPU time is reported. gzip is shown for comparison.

<h3>.3344 lzgt3a</h3>

<p><a href=http://compgt.googlepages.com/lz77>lzgt1</a>
(click on lzgt3a.zip) is one of a group
of free, open source, experimental file compressors by Gerald R. Tamayo, released
July 17, 2008. It uses LZT (Lempel-Ziv-Tamayo) compression, a LZ77 variant
in which the decompresser rebuilds a list of matches sorted by context match
length and the match length is implied or partially implied by the position
in the list. lzgt implements LZT using a 4K sliding window, 32 byte
look-ahead buffer and 3 bit code length. lzgt1 is like lzgt
but uses a 16K sliding window and 128 byte look-ahead buffer.
lzgt2 eliminates the code length entirely. lzgt3 is an improved version
of lzgt2. All programs have separate decompressers (lzgtd1, etc) and are
compiled for DOS (and Windows).

<p>lzgt3a was added Oct. 25, 2008. It uses a 128K window size, 64K
lookahead buffer, and improved coding.

<h3>.3502 pucrunch</h3>

<a href=http://www.cs.tut.fi/~albert/Dev/pucrunch/>pucrunch</a> is a free,
open source file compressor by Pasi Ojala, last updated Mar. 8, 2002.
It uses a combination of run length encoding (RLE) and LZ77 with Elias Gamma coding
of the offsets and run lengths.
The original version was written on Mar. 14, 1997 for the Commodore series
(Vic 20, Commodore 64, Commodore 128 and Commodore Plus 4/C16) in 6510
assembly language, with updates on Dec. 17, 1997 and Oct. 14, 1998.
The 6510 is a 1 MHz, 8 bit microprocessor with 3 registers, 
16 bit (64K) address space, no cache, no pipelining, 8 bit ALU, no multiply or 
floating point instructions, and no support for multitasking or virtual memory.  
The decompresser was designed to execute quickly
in this environment with only a few hundred bytes of memory.

<p>The most recent version was written in Visual C and ported to Windows as a
cross compressor intended to produce self extracting archives for the
Commodore.  By default, pucrunch appends a 276 byte header containing 6510 code to
extract the file.  There are also standalone decompressers written in 6510
assembler and in Z80 assembler.  I could not test in these environments, so I 
used the -d -c0 options to turn off the self extracting feature, which requires 
the (larger) Win32 external compressor/decompresser.

<p>There are two additional limitations.  First, the decompresser appends a 2 byte
header to indicate the load address, which is required by the Commodore.  To
make the decompressed file bitwise identical, this must be stripped off.  Second,
the input file size is limited to 64,936 bytes.  The author tested a modified
version without a file size limit on the Calgary corpus, but this modified version
was not posted, so I did not use it.

<p>To overcome these limitations
I wrote the following Perl scripts to compress and decompress.  The first script
compresses by splitting the input into blocks of 64,936 bytes, compressing them
separately, and appending the compressed files each with a 2 byte header to indicate
the block size.  The second script decompresses each block one at a time, strips
off the 2 byte Commodore header, and appends them.  Each script takes the input
and output files as command line arguments.  The second script is included in
the decompresser size.

  printf(OUT "%s", $s);
  close(TMP2);
}
</pre>

<p>pucrunch suggests using -p1 and -m6 options to improve compression
but these do not help.

<p>Run times are wall times.  Using scripts, Timer 3.01 does not provide
useful process times, since it times Perl rather than pucrunch.
The decompression time (463 sec) is probably high because Windows Task Manager
shows that pucrunch is running only a small fraction of the time, perhaps 10%.
Most of the time is probably the overhead of file I/O and running pucrunch 
15,400 times.

<h3>.3626 urban</h3>
<a href=ftp://ftp.sac.sk/pub/sac/pack/ddjcompr.zip>urban</a> is an open
source file compressor for Unix by Urban Koistinen, Apr. 30, 1991.
The program is an order-2 indirect context model with bitwise arithmetic coding.
A hash of the last two whole bytes plus the previously coded bits
of the current byte (MSB first) are mapped to a hash table of size 710123.
Each table element contains a count of 0s and 1s in the range 0 through 8,
and a hash verification consisting of a second hash. When a collision
is detected, the counts are reset to 0. Otherwise, the appropriate count is
incremented and both are halved if either exceeds 8.

<p>The pair of bit counts and the character count mod 3 (probably unnecessary)
are mapped to a second table of counts to compute
the next-bit probability. That table is updated by incrementing the appropriate
count and halving both if the sum exceeds 60000. The initial mapping
of this second table is (n0,n1) to (n0,n1) except if either of the input counts
is 0, in which case the mapping is (0,n1) to (1,1+2^n1) or (n0,0)
to (1+2^n0,1). The final bit prediction is n1/(n0+n1).

<p>The program was a submission
to a data compresssion context for Dr. Dobbs Journal. To test, the source
code was compiled using make and tested in Linux. It compresses and decompresses
from standard input to standard output. It takes no options.

<h3>.3676 lzw</h3>

<a href=http://www.encode.ru/downloads/lzw01.zip>lzw v0.1</a> is a free, experimental
file compressor by Ilia Muraviev, Jan. 30, 2008.  It uses LZW with 16 bit
code words.  It takes no options.

<p><a href=http://www.encode.ru/downloads/lzw02.zip>lzw v0.2</a> was released with
public domain source code for the decompresser, which zips to 671 bytes.  The file
format is as follows.  There is no header or trailer.
Each 16 bit code word is in machine dependent order
(LSB first on x86).  Codes 0-255 represent single bytes of the same value.
Codes 256-65535 are assigned in ascending order by concatenating the decoded
values of the previous two codes.  After assigning code 65535, new codes are
assigned by replacing the oldest codes first, starting with 256.
Data is decoded into a rotating buffer of size 16 MiB (2<sup>24</sup> bytes)
by copying a string from elsewhere in the buffer.  Neither the original nor
copied string crosses the buffer boundary, and they do not overlap each other.
No new symbol is added after decoding the first byte of the buffer.

<a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1462-MTCompressor?p=28018#post28018>
(discussion)</a>
is a free, experimental command line compressor for Windows by David Catt,
Jan. 20, 2012. It uses an LZ77 variant similar to deflate. It is multi-threaded.
Reported time is real time running on 2 cores (note 26). Memory usage
fluctuates during use. The peak is reported.

<h3>.3790 arbc2z</h3>

<p><a href=http://bijective.dogma.net/arbcx.zip>arbc2z</a> is a free, experimental command line
file compressor with source code by David A. Scott, June 23, 2006.
It is a bijective order-2 (PPM) arithmetic coder.  A bijective
coder has the property that all inputs to the decompresser are valid and produce distinct outputs.
The above archive also contains arbc2, which uses a different method of handling of the zero frequency problem,
arbc1 (order 1), and arbc0 (order 0), all of which are bijective.

<h3>.3800 lz4</h3>

<p><a href=http://img28.xooimage.com/files/b/b/c/lz4-1432530.zip>lz4 v0.2</a>
<a href=http://phantasie.tonempire.net/utilitaires-pc-f2/lz4-fast-compressor-for-windows-t95.htm#144>(website)</a>
is a free file compressor by Yann Collet, Oct. 16, 2009.
It uses LZSS (an LZ77 variant
with flags to mark literals and matches). It takes no options.
Run times are dominated by disk access.

<p><a href=http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2011/01/lz4-worlds-fastest-compressor.html?spref=tw>lz4</a> 0.6
was released Dec. 12, 2010. lz4hc 0.9 (Dec. 13, 2010, same link) is a compatible
version with better compression. In both cases, run times are dominated by
disk access. Times shown are process times.
Actual times were 80+37 sec. for lz4 and 137+39 sec. for lz4hc.
The programs take no compression options.

<p><a href=http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/p/lz4.html>lz4 v1.2</a>
was released Oct. 10, 2011. It has 3 compression  levels (c0...c2).
The program automatically detects the number of cores (2, note 26) and uses the
same number of threads. However compression in mode c0 and all
decompression modes are I/O bound, using about 20% of available CPU.
For these modes, process time is reported. Compression modes c1 and
c2 are real times with both cores fully utilized.

<h3>.3894 xdelta</h3>

<a href=http://code.google.com/p/xdelta/>xdelta</a> 3.0u is a free, open source command line
file compressor by Joshua McDonald, Oct. 12, 2008. It uses LZ77. The program is a delta
coder, meaning it will output the compressed difference between two files, and then
decompress the second file when given the first file uncompressed. It allows the first
file to be omitted, in which case it simply compresses. This is how the test was done.
-9 specifies maximum compression.

<h3>.4092 srank</h3>

<a href=http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~peter-f/>srank 1.1</a> is a free,
open source file compressor by P. M. Fenwick, originally written Sept. 5, 1996
and last updated Apr. 10, 1997.  It uses symbol ranking, like MTF (move to front)
in BWT, but in order 3 contexts without a BWT transform.  When a symbol is encountered
it is encoded with 1, 3, or 4 bits according to its position in a queue of length 3, 
then moved to the front.  Long runs of first place symbols are run length encoded
using 12 bits to encode the length of the length of the run.
A miss is coded using pseudo-MTF in an order-0 context using 7 bits for 
the first 32 symbols and 12 bits for the rest.  It is pseudo-MTF because after a
symbol is found it is swapped with another symbol about half way to the front,
with some dithering.  The algorithm is designed for speed rather than good compression.

<p>The -C8 option selects the maximum number of contexts, 2<sup>18</sup>.
For this test, the C source code was compiled with MinGW 3.4.5:
<pre>
  gcc -O2 -march=pentium4 -fomit-frame-pointer -s srank.c -o srank.exe

<h3>.4106 QuickLZ</h3>

<a href=http://www.quicklz.com/>QuickLZ</a> v0.1 is an open source (GPL)
compression library designed for high speed by Lasse Mikkel Reinhold,
Sept. 24, 2006.  Tests were performed with demo.exe.  Speed is I/O bound.
Times shown are process times, but wall times can be 2-4 times greater.
On enwik9 compression, the program reports "file too big".

<p>Version 0.9 (Oct. 22, 2006) is a faster version (quick.exe)
which handles large (64 bit) files.

<p>Version 1.20 (Mar. 15, 2007) is an archiver rather than a file compressor.

<p>Version <a href=http://www.quicklz.com/beta.html>1.30 beta</a>
(Apr. 16, 2007) has 4 modes (0-3) with 4 separate executables.
Only version 3 (quick3.exe, max compression) was tested.

<p>Version 1.30 (Aug. 14, 2007) modes 0, 1, and 2 are compatible with version 1.20,
but mode 3 (best compression) is new.

<p>Version 1.40 (Nov. 13, 2007) is an experimental version designed for better speed.
It has only one mode.

<h3>.4165 stz</h3>
<a href=http://www.toofiles.com/fr/rawfilesdownload-documents-zip-stz.html>stz 0.7.2</a>
is a free, experimental file compressor by Bruno Wyttenbach, Feb. 15, 2011.
It uses LZ77. It has 4 compression modes as shown in the table below. Times are process
times. Real times are closer to 40-45 seconds. Memory is 3.3. MB for all compression modes
and the same for decompression. Most of the memory is for I/O buffers (2MB each). The actual algorithm
uses 48 KB. Modes -c and -c3 compress to the same size but the archives
differ by 1 byte in the header. stz.exe zip size is 40,425.

<p><a href=http://www.toofiles.com/fr/rawfilesdownload-documents-zip-5313_stz.html>stz 0.8</a>,
Mar. 4, 2011,
improves compression and adds two new experimental modes. Compression and decompression process times
in ns/byte are given below for both enwik8 and enwik9. Wall times are slower due to disk I/O.
Modes -c, -c1, and -c2 select best
compression speed, best uncompression speed, and best size respectively, but this appears only
to hold for enwik8, probably because of disk I/O interference. Modes -c3, -c4, and -c5 produce identical
archives. Additional changes are a Drag'n'drop interface, a CRC check (adds 2% to time),
and more flexible command line interface. 5313_stz.zip size is 41,941.

<h3>.4382 lzrw3-a</h3>

<a href=http://www.ross.net/compression/>lzrw3-a</a> is one of a series
of public domain (open source) memory to memory compressors by 
Ross Williams in 1991.  The programs were
<a href=lzrw.zip>implemented</a>
as file compressors by Matt Mahoney on Feb. 14, 2008.  The programs
are as follows:

<p>lzrw1 (Mar. 31, 1991)
is byte-aligned LZ77 with a 12 bit offset and 4 bit length field
allowing lengths 3-16.  Each group of 16 phrases (pointers or literals)
is preceded by 2 flag bytes to distinguish pointers from literals.  
Matches are found using a 4K hash table without confirmation which is 
updated after each phrase.  It uses 16K of memory plus the input and
output buffers.

<p>lzrw1-a (June 25, 1991)
is lzrw1 except that the length field represents values 3-18.

<p>lzrw2 (June 29, 1991)
replaces the offset with a 12 bit index into a rotating table
of offsets, allowing the last 4K phrases (rather than 4K bytes) to
be reached.  The decompresser must reconstruct the phrase table
(but not the hash table).  It uses 24K memory plus buffers.

<p>lzrw3 (June 30, 1991)
replaces the 12 bit length field with a 12 bit index into the
hash table.  The decompresser must reconstruct the hash table.
It uses 16K memory plus buffers.

<p>lzrw3-a (July 15, 1991)
uses a deep hash table (8 offsets per hash) with LRU replacement.
It uses 16K memory plus buffers.

<p>lzrw5 (July 17, 1991) uses LZW.  The dictionary is implemented as a tree.
It uses up to 384K memory plus buffers.

<p>There is an experimental lzrw4, but it was never fully implemented.

<p>All of the compression algorithms were originally implemented as
memory to memory compression functions in C, not as complete programs.
I wrote a driver program which divides the input into 1 MB blocks (except lzrw5),
compresses them independently by calling the provided functions, and
writing the compressed size as a 4 byte number followed by the compressed
data.  However, compression could be improved by using larger blocks at
the cost of more memory.  For lzrw5 the block size is 64K because the program
is not guaranteed to work correctly for larger blocks.  It did work on this
benchmark for a 192K block size, but not for 256K.  The distribution linked
above uses a 64K block size.

<h3>.4473 fcm1</h3>

<a href=http://encode.ru/downloads/fcm1.zip>fcm1</a> is a free, open source file compressor
by Ilia Muraviev, May 23, 2008.  It mixes order 0 and order 1 models and uses bitwise
arithmetic coding as in fpaq0 and paq.  The bit predictions are combined by weighted averaging,
with the order 1 model weighted 15/16 unless the model is in its initial state, in which
case the order 0 model prediction is used.  Each context is mapped to 2 16-bit counters
in initial state 1/2.  One counter is updated by 1/8 of the prediction error and the
other by 1/32.  The model prediction is the average of these two values.
The compressed file has a 4 byte header containing the file size.

was available only for 64 bit Windows on Oct. 30, 2012, and was not tested.

<h3>.4930 FastLZ</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.fastlz.org/>FastLZ</a> is a free, open source compression
library and file compressor by Ariya Hidayat, announced June 12, 2007 with
no date or version number, and downloaded and tested on June 16, 2007.  
It uses byte-aligned LZ77.  The software was released
as source code only (in C).  For this test it was compiled with MinGW gcc 3.4.5
as suggested by README.TXT (plus -s to strip debugging info):
<pre>
  gcc -march=pentium -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -mtune=pentium 6pack.c fastlz.c -o 6pack -s
  gcc -march=pentium -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -mtune=pentium 6unpack.c fastlz.c -o 6unpack -s
</pre>
6pack and 6unpack are the compressor and decompresser, respectively.  They take no
options.  The compressed file name is stored without a path in the archive.

<h3>.4975 flzp</h3>

<p><a href=flzp.zip>flzp v1</a> is a free,
open source file compressor by Matt Mahoney, June 18, 2008.  It uses byte-oriented LZP.
The input is divided into blocks such that at least 33 byte values never occur, or 64KB,
whichever is smaller, then uses those bytes to code an end of block symbol plus match
lengths from 2 up to the number of unused bytes - 1.  A match length is decoded by
finding the most recent context hash match in a 4 MB rotating buffer and outputting
the bytes that follow.  It uses a 1M hash table and an order 4 context hash.
Each block begins with a 32 byte bitmap to distinguish symbols for matches from literals.
flzp can be used as a preprocessor to a low order compressor like fpaq0 or ppmd -o3
to improve compression and speed.

<h3>.5277 snappy</h3>

<p><a href=http://code.google.com/p/snappy/>snappy</a> 1.0.1 is a free, open source (Apache)
compression library for Linux from Google, Mar. 25, 2011. It uses byte aligned LZ77, and is
intended for high speed rather than good compression. Google uses snappy internally
to compress its data structures for its search engine.

<p>The compressed data contains tag bytes such that the low 2 bits
indicate literals and matches as follows:
<pre>
  00 = literal
  01 = 1 byte match
  10 = 2 byte match
  11 = 4 byte match (not used)
</pre>
<p>A literal of length 1 to 60 is encoded by storing the length - 1 in the upper 6 bits.
Longer literals are coded by storing 60..63 in the upper 6 bits to indicate that
the length is encoded in the next 1 to 4 bytes in little-endian (LSB first)
format. This is followed by the uncompressed literals.

<p>Matches of length 4 to 11 with offsets of 1 to 2047 are encoded using a 1 byte
match. The match length - 4 is stored in the middle 3 bits of the tag byte.
The most significant 3 bits of the offset are stored in the most significant
3 bits of the tag byte. The lower 8 bits of the offset are stored in the next byte.
A match may overlap the area to be copied. Thus, the string "abababa" could be
written using a literal "ab" and a match with an offset of 2 and length of 5.
This would be encoded as:
<pre>
  000001 00  (literal of length 2)
  01100001   (literal 'a')
  01100010   (literal 'b')
  000 001 01 (high bits of offset, match of length 5)
  00000010   (low 8 bits of offset)
</pre>

<p>Matches of length 1 to 64 with offsets of 1 to 65535 are encoded using a 2
byte match. The length - 1 is encoded in the high 6 bits of the tag byte
The offset is stored in the next 2 bytes with the least significant bit first.
Longer matches are encoded as a series of 64 byte matches with a final
shorter match of 4 to 63. If the final part of the match is less than 4 then
it is encoded as a 60 byte match plus a 4 to 7 byte match.

<p>A 4 byte match allows offsets up to 2<sup>32</sup> - 1 to be encoded
as with a 2 byte match. The decompresser will decode them but the compressor
does not produce them because the input is compressed in 32K blocks such
that a match does not span a block boundary.

<p>The entire sequence of matches and literals is preceded by the
uncompressed length up to 2<sup>32</sup> - 1 written in base 128, LSB first,
using 1 to 5 digits in the low 7 bits. The high bit is 1 to indicate that
more digits follow.

<p>Compression searches for matches by comparing a hash of the 4 current
bytes with previous occurrences of the same hash earlier in the 32K block.
The hash function interprets the 4 bytes as a 32 bit value, LSB first,
multiplies by 0x1e35a7bd, and shifts out the low bits. The hash table
size is the smallest power of 2 in the range 256 to 16384 that is at
least as large as the input string. As an optimization for hard to
compress data, after 32 failures to find a match, the compressor
checks only every second location in the input for the next 32 tests,
then every third for the next 32 tests, and so on. When it finds a match,
it goes back to testing every location.

<p>As another optimization for the x86-64 architecture, copies of 16
bytes or less are done using two 64-byte assignments rather than memcpy().
To support this, if 15 or fewer bytes remain after a match then they
are encoded as literals with no further search.

<p>Snappy compresses from memory to memory rather than from file to file, so it was
necessary to write a small test program (below), which was not included in the
compressed size. The program loads the input into a string, compresses or decompresses
it to a new string, and writes it to output. It gives the best possible compression
but is not optimal for speed or memory. With this test, speed is 25 ns/byte
for compression and 12 ns/byte for decompression (under 64 bit Linux).
In a separate test (not shown), compressing in 32K chucks takes 9 ns/byte with
very slightly larger size due to storing the size in each chunk. Decompression
was not tested in this mode, but should be twice as fast. Memory usage
for the test program is 2 GB to store the input and output, but actual
memory usage by the library is at most 32K for the hash table.

<p>The test program
was compiled with g++ 4.4.5 -O3 in 64 bit Ubuntu Linux and linked to
Snappy after running "./configure; make". Use -DMODE=Compress or
-DMODE=Uncompress to create a compressor or decompresser respectively.

<h3>.5322 bpe</h3>

<a href=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/cluster/RJK/Compress/problem.html>bpe</a>
is a free, experimental file compressor by Philip Gage. It was published
as source code only in "The C Users Journal" in Feb. 1994. It uses byte
pair encoding. The input is divided into blocks which are iteratively
compressed by finding the most frequent byte pair and replacing it with
another byte value that never occurs in the block, until all of the
unused bytes are used up or no pair occurs more than a minumum number
of times.

<p>For testing, I compiled with gcc 4.4.0 -s -O2 -march=pentiumpro
-fomit-frame-pointer. I used the recommended compression options
"5000 4096 200 3" and did not try to find a better combination.
The options say to use a maximum block size of 5000, a hash table
size of 4096 (it is recommended to be 5% to 20% smaller than the block
size), a maximum of 200 different byte values per block, and do not
replace pairs that occur less than 3 times.

<h3>.5427 bpe2</h3>

<a href=bpe2.cpp>bpe2 v1</a> is a free, experimental, open source (public domain)
file compressor by Will, Jan. 15, 2010. It uses byte pair encoding. It divides
the input into blocks of 8192 bytes which are compressed independently. A block
is compressed by finding the byte pair which occurs most frequently and a byte
value which never occurs in the block, and then substituing that byte value
for each occurrence of the pair. The byte pair and its replacement are appended
to the block as a 3 byte header. The process is repeated until either there
are no unused byte values left, or there is no pair that occurs at least 4 times.
The block is output with an additional 2 byte header to indicate its size.

<p><a href=bpe2v2.cpp>bpe2 v2</a>, Jan. 15, 2010,
uses a faster algorithm to find the most
frequent byte pair during compression.

<p>fpaq0 uses a 32-bit carryless arithmetic coder to code binary decisions
and output one byte at a time.  fpaq1 uses a 64 bit coder.  fpaq0b uses
a 32 bit coder but counts carries and outputs a bit at a time to
achieve greater internal precision.  fpaq0s improves on fpaq0b by
using the compressed EOF to encode the uncompressed EOF, unlike the
other models which code an extra bit for each byte to indicate the end.
fpaq02 extends this idea to 64 bits.
All programs except fpaq are C++ source code and compiled as follows
with MinGW 3.4.2 (where %1 is the program name):
<pre>
g++ -Wall %1.cpp -O2 -Os -march=pentiumpro -fomit-frame-pointer -s -o %1.exe
</pre>

<p><a href=http://www.encode.ru/downloads/fpaq0p.zip>fpaq0p</a> by Ilia
Muraviev, Apr. 15, 2007, uses an adaptive order 0 model.  Instead of keeping
a 0,1 count for each context, it keeps a probability and updates it by
adjusting by 1/32 of the error.  This is faster because it avoids a division
instruction.

<p><a href=fpaqa.zip>fpaqa</a> by
Matt Mahoney, Dec. 15, 2007, is the first implementation of Jarek Duda's
asymmetric binary coder, described in section 3 of
<a href=http://uk.arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0710/0710.3861v1.pdf>
Optimal encoding on discrete lattice with translational invariant constrains
using statistical algorithms</a>, 2007.

<p>The model is based on fpaq0p (adaptive order 0), but with probabilities
modeled with 16 bits resolution (instead of 12) to improve compression.
The source (GPL) can be compiled with -DARITH to substitute the arithmetic coder
from fpaq0 and fpaq0p for the asymmetric coder.

<p>An asymmetric coder has a single N-bit integer state variable x, as opposed to
two variables (low and high) in an arithmetic coder, which allows a lookup
table implementation.  In fpaqa, N=10.  A bit d (0 or 1) with probability q = P(d = 1)
(0 &lt; q &lt; 1, a multiple of 2<sup>-N</sup>) is coded:
<pre>
  if d = 0 then x := ceil((x+1)/(1-q)) - 1
  if d = 1 then x := floor(x/q)
</pre>
To decode, given x and q
<pre>
  d = ceil((x+1)*q) - ceil(x*q)  (1 if fract(x*q) &gt;= 1-q, else 0)
  if d = 0 then x := x - ceil(x*q)
  if d = 1 then x := ceil(x*q)
</pre>
x is maintained in the range 2<sup>N</sup> to 2<sup>N+1</sup>-1 by writing the
low bits of x prior to encoding d and reading into the low bits of x after
decoding.  Because compression and decompression are reverse operations of
each other, they must be performed in reverse order.
The encoder divides the input into blocks of size B=500K bits, saves the predictions (q)
in a stack, then encodes the bits in reverse order to a second stack. 
The block size and final state x are then written, followed by the compressed bits in 
the second stack in reverse order that they were
coded.  The decompresser runs everything in the forward direction,
reading the saved x at the beginning of each block.

<p>To reduce the size of the coding tables, q is quantized to R=7 bits on a nonlinear
scale with closer spacing near 0 and 1.  The quantization is such that ln(q/(1-q))
is a multiple of 1/8 between -8 and 8.

<p>In the source, N, R, and B are adjustable parameters up to N=12, R=7.
Larger values improve compression at the expense of speed and memory.
fpaqa uses 2<sup>N+R+2</sup> + 5*B/4 bytes for compression
and 2<sup>N+R+1</sup> bytes for decompression.

<p><a href=fpaqb.zip>fpaqb</a>
(Matt Mahoney, Dec. 17, 2007, updated to ver 2 on Dec. 20, 2007)
is a revision of fpaqa, using the same model, but using an asymmetric
coder that uses direct calculations in place of lookup tables to update
the state.  This allows higher precision to improve compression (eliminating
a 0.03% penalty), saving memory, and allowing bytewise I/O (x in range
2<sup>N</sup> to 2<sup>N+8</sup>-1 for N=12).  Compression
is about the same speed as fpaqa but decompression is 28% faster.
Ver. 2 is faster but maintains archive compatibility with ver. 1.

<p><a href=http://www.encode.ru/downloads/fpaq0m.zip>fpaq0m</a>
by Ilia Muraviev, Dec. 20, 2007,
uses arithmetic coding and 2 order 0 models averaged
together, one with fast update (rate 1/16) and one slow (1/64).

<p><a href=http://shelwien.googlepages.com/fpaq0mw.rar>fpaq0mw</a>
by Eugene Shelwien, Dec. 21, 2007, modifies fpaq0m by using a weighted
mix of a fast (1/16) and slow (1/256) adapting order 0 model, where
the weight is adjusted dynamically to favor the better model.

<p><a href=fpaqc.zip>fpaqc</a>
(Matt Mahoney, Dec. 24, 2007) is fpaqb with some optimizations
to the asymmetric coder.

<p><a href=http://www.encode.ru/downloads/fpaq0pv2.zip>fpaq0pv2</a>
(Ilia Muraviev, Dec. 26, 2007) is a speed optimized version of fpaq0p
with arithmetic coding.

<p><a href=fpaq0r.zip>fpaq0r</a>
by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Jan. 9, 2008, is an order 0 model with arithmetic
coding.  The model is tuned for better text compression.  When compiled
with -DSLOWER (fpaq0rs.exe), the arithmetic coder uses higher precision
for better compression with a small speed penalty.

<p><a href=fpaq0f.zip>fpaq0f</a>
by Matt Mahoney, Jan. 28, 2008, uses an adaptive order 0 model which
includes the bit history (as an 8 bit state) in each context.
(It is controversial whather this is really "order 0").
It uses arithmetic coding with 16 bit probabilities (rather than 12 bits).

<p><a href=fpaq0f2.zip>fpaq0f2</a>
by Matt Mahoney, Jan. 30, 2008, uses a simplified bit history consisting
of just the last 8 bits, plus some minor improvements.

<p><a href=http://www.winturtle.netsons.org/fpaq0pv3.zip>fpaq0pv3</a>
by Nania Francesco Antonio, Apr 04, 2008, is compatible with fpaq0p but 20-30% faster.

<p><a href=http://shelwien.googlepages.com/fpaq0pv4.rar>fpaq0pv4</a>
including fpaq0pv4nc and fpaq0pv4nc0, are speed optimizations by Eugene
Shelwien, Apr. 6, 2008, as discussed
<a href=http://encode.ru/forums/index.php?action=vthread&forum=1&topic=671#msg9437>here</a>.
fpaq0pv4 is compatible with fpaq0p but faster.  The nc and nc0 variants dispense with the
extra EOF flags in each byte.

<p><a href=http://shelwien.googlepages.com/fpaq0pv4b.rar>fpaq0pv4b</a> by
Eugene Shelwien, Apr. 18, 2008, replaces the arithmetic coder with
sh_v1m port (uses carries), Windows I/O, and other optimizations as discussed
<a href=http://encode.ru/forums/index.php?action=vthread&forum=1&topic=679#msg9654>here</a>.
The Intel-compiled .exe only runs on Intel machines. I tested
<a href=http://shelwien.googlepages.com/fpaq0pv4B1.exe>fpaq0pv4b1</a> which was
patched on May 19, 2008 to run on AMD machines.

<h3>.5793 ppp</h3>

<a href=ppp.zip>ppp</a> is
the public domain file compressor specified in
<a href=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1978.txt>RFC 1978</a> for
datagram compression using the Point-to-Point Protocol.
The RFC includes an implementation in C written by Dave Rand with modifications
by Ian Donaldson and Carsten Bormann, published in Aug. 1996.
The program uses order-4 symbol ranking with a queue length of 1
with a 64K hash table without collision detection.  Match flags
are packed 8 to a byte, followed by up to 8 literals for each incorrect guess.
The 16 bit context hash is updated by shifting left 4 bits and XORing with the
current byte.  The program reads from a file and outputs to stdout like this:
<pre>
  ppp enwik9 > enwik9.ppp     (compress)
  ppp -d enwik9.ppp > enwik9  (decompress)
</pre>
The original code opens both files in text mode, which does not work in Windows.
For testing, I modified 3 lines of code to open the input and output files
in binary mode as follows:
<pre>
  #include &lt;fcntl.h>  // added
  setmode(fileno(stdout), O_BINARY);  // added
  FILE *f = fopen(*p, "rb");  // changed "r" to "rb"
</pre>
I compiled using gcc 3.4.2 <tt>-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer
-march=pentiumpro</tt> and packed with UPX (linked above, Feb. 11 2008).
Times are wall times.  I did not use timer 3.01
because its output would be redirected to the output file.  Process times
are about 50% of wall time based on watching Task Manager.

<h3>.6368 NTFS</h3>

<p>NTFS disk compression is used in Microsoft
Windows when the "compress files to save disk space"
checkbox is checked in the folder properties dialog box. Disk compression was
introduced in NTFS v1.2 in mid 1995 according to
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS#File_compression>Wikipedia</a>.
The compression format is called LZNT1. The algorithm is propretary. However, it was
<a href=http://www.nf-team.org/drmad/zf/zf5/zf5_025.htm>reverse engineered</a>
(in Russian, see also <a href=http://encode.ru/forum/showthread.php?t=260>here</a>).
The algorithm is LZSS (similar to lzrw1).
The format consists of groups of 8 symbols each preceded by 8 flag bits packed
into a byte. A 0 bit indicates a literal symbol, which is decoded by copying it.
A 1 bit indicates a 2 byte offset-length pair which is decoded by going back 'offset'
bytes in the output and copying the next 'length'+3 bytes. An offset-length pair
uses a variable number of bits allocated
to the offset (from 4 to 12) depending on the position in the file, and any
remaining bits allocated to the length of the match. A 12 bit offset would
correspond to a 4 KB block on disk.

<p>I tested by copying enwik9 between folders with the compression turned on
in one folder, and compared with times to copy between
two folders both with compression turned off.
I tried each copy twice and took the second time, which was at most 1 second
faster than the first copy. I used the test machine in note 26 running Windows
Vista Home Premium SP1 32 bit with 3 GB memory and
a 200 GB disk between folders on the same partition.
Copying between two uncompressed folders takes 41 seconds. Copying to a compressed
folder takes 51 seconds, or a difference of 10 seconds.
Copying from a compressed folder takes 35 seconds. I estimated 9 seconds for
decompression by assuming that copying the compressed file directly
would take 26 seconds based on its size of 636 MB. (This is probably wrong
because the file would be cached in memory uncompressed, but the alternative
is a negative time for decompression. Copying either the compressed or uncompressed
file to NUL: takes 2 seconds on the second try).

<p>Times were recorded with a watch because timer 3.01 will not time built-in commands
like 'copy'. Task Manager does not show any processes consuming CPU time or memory
during copying. However, memory use should be insignificant (under 16 KB) for
LZSS with 4 KB blocks. Sizes are as reported by right clicking on the compressed
file in Explorer as 'size on disk'. The size of the decompression program is not known.

<a href=http://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?p=27579#27579>(mirror)</a> is
a series of 3 free command line file compressors by Piotr Tarsa.  All are
order-0 arithmetic coders with identical models written in assembler (included).
The three variants are fs (frequency sorting), bt (binary tree), and
sl (linear search).  All three produce identical sized compressed files.
In addition, the compressed output of bt and sl are identical.
Results for all 3 variations are below.  Comp and Decomp show global
times including disk I/O in ns/byte, with CPU (process) times in parenthesis.
Date is the latest program timestamp in the distribution, not the release date.

<h3>.6445 arb255</h3>

<a href=http://bijective.dogma.net/compres11.htm>arb255</a> is a
free, experimental command line file compressor with source code availalbe
by David A. Scott, July 28, 2004.
It is a bijective order-0 arithmetic coder, best suited for i.i.d. bytes

<a href=http://cgi.sover.net/cgi-bin/bsdi-man?proto=1.1&query=compact&msection=1&apropos=0>(man page)</a>
is a file compressor by Colin L. Mc Master, Feb. 28, 1979.  It was written in K&amp;R C for
VAX/PDP11 and SUN under Berkeley UNIX.  It uses adaptive order-0 Huffman coding.
The (separate) decompression program rebuilds the Huffman tree, so it need not be transmitted.

<p>Neither program takes options.  compact deletes the input file and creates an output file
with a .C extension.  uncompact deletes the compressed file and restores the original.
compact was later superceded by <i>compress</i>, which gives better compression.

<p>For this test, compact was compiled using the provided Makefile and tested under
Ubuntu Linux.  Minor source code corrections were needed to compile under gcc.
However, the decompresser size is based on the original code.  A port to Windows would
be possible but would require more source code changes.

<h3>.6955 smile</h3>

and <a href=http://256bytes.untergrund.net/demo/399>smile256</a> (Dec. 5, 2004)
<a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1624-Win32-binary-compressor-with-smallest-native-(EXE)-footprint-not-best-ratio-question>
(discussion)</a>
are free, open source file compressors by Andrei Frolov.
These programs are unique for their small executable size.
smile consists of two programs: a 250 byte compressor, smile_e.com
and a 207 byte decompresser, smile_d.com. smile256 is both a compressor
and a decompresser in 256 bytes. This includes code to parse the command
line and open the input and output files.
Source code is in 16 bit assembler for DOS.
Program size is given for the uncompressed .com files because zip
makes them larger.

<p>Both programs use a move-to-front algorithm with the queue position
encoded using an interleaved Elias Gamma code. The position of the
current byte in the queue (1..256) is encoded by dropping the leading 1 bit,
preceding each of the remaining bits with a 0 bit, then terminating with
a 1 bit. After encoding, the byte value is moved to the front of the queue.
smile256 also encodes EOF as 257, resulting in a file that
is usually 1 byte larger than smile_e.

<h3>.7594 barf</h3>

<a href=barf.html>barf</a> is a free,
open source file compressor by Matt Mahoney, Sept. 21, 2003.  It was written
as a joke to debunk claims of recursive compression.  The algorithm is as
follows:
<ol>
<li>If the input is one of the 14 files of the Calgary corpus, the output
is coded as 1 byte to indicate which file.
<li>If not, then the input is compressed with a byte oriented LZ77 code,
in which bytes 0-31 code a literal of that length, and 32-255 code a
match of length 2 and offset 0-223.
<li>If step 2 does not compress, then the first byte is removed and a
filename extension is added to encode that byte.
</ol>
The main table shows the size and total process time after 2 compression passes.
Further passes will "compress" by one byte.  The decompresser source code 
size includes the Calgary corpus, which is needed to build the executable.
(barf.exe is 1,009,274 bytes after packing with UPX and zip).  Results by pass
are shown below.  Times are process times (Timer 3.01) with actual wall times
in parenthesis.

<p>A similar program, barfest.exe, compresses the million random digits file to
1 byte, rather than the Calgary corpus.  The decompresser size is
455,755 bytes (zipped).

<h3>hipp</h3>

<p><a href=http://www.compression.ru/download/articles/cm/hipp/hipp5819.html>hipp</a> v0.5819
is an experimental command line file compressor with source code available by
Bogatov Roman, Aug. 19, 2005.  It uses context mixing with ordinary and optionally sparse
(fixed gap) contexts, using a suffix tree with path compression to store statistics.
The options are /m to specify the memory limit in MB (default /m2048),
/o to specify primary context order, i.e. the depth of the suffix tree
with path compression (default /o256), /do to set max
deterministic order (actual order with path decompression) (default /do256, do >= o),
/so to set the number of sparse contexts (default /so0).  Sparse contexts
are useful for binary data but generally not text.  Memory usage increases
with the size of the file and with /o and /so (but not /do).  Also, if the
memory limit is exceeded then an error occurs.  Unfortunately enwik9 cannot
be compressed at all because initialization requires more than 800 MB.
Some results for enwik8:

<h3>XMill</h3>

<a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmill>XMill</a> 0.8 is an open source
command line XML preprocessor/compressor by AT&T, written by Dan Suciu,
Hartmut Liefke, and Hedzer Westra in March, 2003.
It works by sorting by XML tags to bring similar content together, then
compressing with gzip, bzip2, or ppmd.  Optionally it can (in theory) output the
preprocessed data as input to another compressor.

<p>Unfortunately, the compressor will not accept truncated XML files such as this benchmark.
It can be made to work by appending the following 38 bytes to enwik8 or enwik9
to create a properly formed XML file (a trailing newline is optional but was not used):
<pre>
"&lt;/text>&lt;/revision>&lt;/page>&lt;/mediawiki>
</pre>
However, decompression succeeds for enwik8 but fails for enwik9.  (Failed
values in parenthesis, timed for enwik8).  The decompresser (xdemill) reports "corrupt file".

</pre>
The -w option preserves whitespace.  Otherwise compression is lossy.  -P selects ppmdi compression
(bzip2, gzip and no compression are also available).  -9 selects maximum compression.  -m800 allows
800 MB of memory.

<p>In theory, using no compression (-N) would allow XMill to be used as a preprocessor to other
compressors.  However, the decompresser will not accept either enwik8 or enwik9 (with closing
tags appended) if processed with -N (reports "corrupt file").

<p><a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/suciu/XMILL/xmill-0.9.1.tar.gz>xmill 0.9.1</a>

<h3>lzp3o2</h3>

<a href=http://cbloom.com/src/index_lz.html>lzp3o2</a> (LZP 3 with order 2 literal
coding) is one of a family of open source file compressors by
Charles Bloom, originally written in 1995.  The algorithm is described in
a <a href=http://cbloom.com/papers/lzp.html>paper</a> submitted to DCC'96.
lzp3o2 uses LZP compression with order 2 modeling of literals and arithmetic
coding.  The tested version of the source code
is dated Aug. 25, 1996 and compiled for Windows Oct. 10, 1998.  The compiled
distribution from <a href=http://cbloom.com/exe/lzpexes.zip>here</a> was tested.
<pre>
Program    enwik8     Comp  Deco  Mem  Alg
-------  ----------   ----  ----  ---  ---
lzp1     56,013,656     23    20  153  LZP

lzp3o2   33,041,439    230   270  151  LZP
</pre>

<p>All programs report "malloc failed" on enwik9.  The LZP algorithms
use very little memory themselves, but these implementations allocate
input and output buffers all at once.  This fails for enwik9 because of
the 2 GB process limit in Windows.

<p>lzp1 is both a compressor and decompresser.  To decompress, use -d as
the third argument.  lzp2 is a compressor only.  There is a source code
decompresser "lzp2d" but I was unsuccessful in compiling it.
It allows an unexplained option "HuffType" which I did not experiment with.
lzp3o2 has a separate decompresser "lzp3o2d.exe" included in the distribution.
